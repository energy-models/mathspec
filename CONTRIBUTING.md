# Contributing guidelines

We're glad you're reading this; we welcome all contributors!

Some of the resources to look at if you're interested in contributing:

- Look at open issues tagged with ["help wanted"](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and ["good first issue"](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- Look at the [contributing guide in our documentation](https://mathspec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/)

## Licensing

Copyright (c) 2026 mathspec contributors.
By contributing to mathspec, i.e. through opening a pull request, you represent that your contributions are your own original work and that you have the right to license them, and you agree that your contributions are licensed under the .

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

You can open an issue on GitHub to report bugs or request new mathspec features.
Follow these links to submit your issue:

- [Report bugs or other problems while running mathspec](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/new?template=BUG-REPORT.yml).
  If reporting an error, please include a full traceback in your issue.

- [Request features that mathspec does not already include](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/new?template=FEATURE-REQUEST.yml).

- [Report missing or inconsistent information in our documentation](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/new?template=DOCS.yml).

- [Any other issue](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/new).

## Submitting changes

Look at the [development guide in our documentation](https://mathspec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/) for information on how to get set up for development.

To contribute changes:

1. Fork the project on GitHub.
1. Create a feature branch to work on in your fork (`git checkout -b new-fix-or-feature`).
1. Test your changes using `pixi run test`, or `pixi run ci` for everything CI will check.
1. Commit your changes to the feature branch (you should have `pre-commit` installed to ensure your code is correctly formatted when you commit changes).
1. Push the branch to GitHub (`git push origin new-fix-or-feature`).
1. On GitHub, create a new [pull request](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/new/main) from the feature branch.

When you contribute for the first time, ensure your reviewer [adds you as a contributor](https://allcontributors.org/en/bot/)!

### Pull requests

Before submitting a pull request, check whether you have:

- Written the PR title as a conventional commit subject (see below).
- Added its line under `## Upcoming version` in `CHANGELOG.md` by hand, if the PR is a `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs` or `revert` (see below).
- Added or updated documentation for your changes (see [The docs](#the-docs)).
- Added tests if you implemented new functionality.

When opening a pull request, please provide a clear summary of your changes!

### The docs

`docs/` is both the site and what you read on GitHub. **What a page is for
decides where it goes, in the nav and in the tree**: a tutorial (`docs/`), a
how-to guide (`docs/howto/`), reference (`docs/reference/`, and the example pages
in `docs/examples/`) or explanation (`docs/about/`) — the four kinds of
[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr) — and one page is one kind. A page a spec
writer does not need goes under Development in the nav: building on
mathspec, contributing, or a proof of concept. The rules each kind has to meet, and the sentence-level
bar, are in
[the docs-writing skill](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/blob/main/.claude/skills/docs-writing/SKILL.md).
Every page needs a `nav:` entry in `mkdocs.yml`, links inside `docs/` are
relative, and a link outside it is the full GitHub URL. `pixi run docs-build`
is `--strict` and refuses a dead link or a stale anchor; `pixi run test` is
what refuses a page with no nav entry.

### Commit messages

Merges are squashed, so the **PR title** becomes the commit on `main`. Write it
so it also works as the line you add to `CHANGELOG.md` by hand. It must be a
[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) subject:

```text
<type>[(scope)]: <subject>

feat: AST parsing for indexed constraints
fix(parser): where clauses with a trailing comma
docs: describe the two expression tiers
```

A `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs` or `revert` PR adds its title,
with a link to the PR, under `## Upcoming version` in `CHANGELOG.md`. A
`chore`, `test`, `ci`, `build` or `style` PR adds no line. The
`Conventional commit subject` check enforces the format on every pull request,
and the `Changelog line` check enforces the line. The label `no changelog`
opts a PR out of the second.
See [RELEASING.md](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/blob/main/RELEASING.md).

Beyond the subject line, write whatever body the change deserves — a paragraph
or bullet list covering what changed and its impact.

### Code conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.

We mostly follow the official [Style Guide for Python Code (PEP8)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

We have chosen to use the uncompromising code formatter and linter [`ruff`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/).
When run from the root directory of this repo, `pyproject.toml` should ensure that formatting and linting fixes are in line with our custom preferences (e.g., maximum line length).
To make this a smooth experience, you should run `pixi run pre-commit-install` after setting up your development environment.
If you prefer, you can also set up your IDE to run these two tools whenever you save your files, and to have `ruff` highlight erroneous code directly as you type.
Take a look at their documentation for more information on configuring this.

We require all new contributions to have docstrings for all modules, classes and methods.
When adding docstrings, we request you use the [Google docstring style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

## Releases

A release is a PR that renames `## Upcoming version` in `CHANGELOG.md` to the
version and the day, such as `## 0.1.0 (2026-10-01)`, and edits the section
into the release notes. Merging it tags the release, opens the GitHub release
and publishes the package to PyPI.

The version is never written down in the source tree — it comes from the git
tag at build time, and `mathspec.__version__` reads it back from the installed
package metadata.

See [RELEASING.md](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/blob/main/RELEASING.md) for the steps, what to do when one
fails, and the one-time repository setup.

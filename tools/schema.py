"""The checked-in JSON Schema for the YAML surface.

    pixi run python -m tools.schema   # rewrite schema/mathspec.schema.json

The document is ``Spec.model_json_schema()`` — the shape pydantic validates,
nothing more: ``expression:`` and ``where:`` are strings to it, so their
grammars stay invisible to any editor reading this. ``tests/test_schema.py``
asserts the committed file equals what this produces, so the artefact cannot
drift from the models.

    The drift test runs both against the locked dev pydantic and at the
    declared floor (the bare-install job resolves ``lowest-direct``), so the
    render must not depend on which generated it. Four rewrites:

    - non-finite ``default`` values are dropped — ``json.dumps`` would write
      the literal ``Infinity``, which JSON cannot spell and every non-Python
      validator refuses; ``default`` is advisory, so nothing is lost;
    - ``description`` is ``inspect.cleandoc``'d — newer pydantic dedents
      docstrings itself, older ships the raw indentation;
    - a one-element ``allOf`` holding a bare ``$ref`` collapses to the
      ``$ref`` — older pydantic wraps a ref that has siblings, 2020-12
      allows it unwrapped and newer pydantic writes it so;
    - ``additionalProperties: true`` is dropped — it is the dialect's default,
      which newer pydantic spells out on an open mapping and older leaves
      implicit. The ``false`` every strict block carries is kept.

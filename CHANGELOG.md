# Changelog

Each pull request adds its line under `## Upcoming version`. A release pull
request renames that heading to the version and the day, such as
`## 0.1.0 (2026-10-01)`, and edits the section into the release notes. Merging
it releases that version ([RELEASING.md](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/blob/main/RELEASING.md)).

## Upcoming version

- feat(language): a named expression may declare the frame it is read over ([#741](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/741))
- docs: code examples on the site are readable in light and dark mode, and a diagram shows what mathspec leaves to engines and other tools ([#730](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/730))
- docs: the site follows the reader's light or dark setting, and a page shows where it sits in the navigation ([#727](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/727))
- feat(language): two files that state the same spec write one text, and `canonical --check` fails a file that is not in it ([#731](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/731))

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-25)

A file now states a **specification**, or **spec**. A **model** is a spec with
data attached, which an engine builds and a solver takes. mathspec holds specs
only. The API, the messages and the docs use the two words in these senses
([glossary](https://mathspec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/glossary/)).

This release breaks three things:

- The first parameter of `to_spec`, `advice`, `typeset`, `typeset_declaration`,
  `to_latex`, `to_typst` and `to_markdown` is `spec`, not `model`. A call that
  passes `model=` by keyword fails. A positional call works as before.
- The module `mathspec.model` is now `mathspec.spec`. `from mathspec import Spec`
  works as before.
- Error and advice messages say "spec" where they said "model". A test that
  matches the old text fails.

The pull requests in this release:

- feat!: what a file states is called a spec, the functions that read one take it as spec, and model means a spec with data ([#721](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/721))
- docs: the README and the docs home page say that spec is short for specification ([#724](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/724))
- fix(docs): the Python API pages link every name a docstring cites, and show advice as the function it is ([#720](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/720))

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-25)

🎉 mathspec is officially on PyPI!

```bash
pip install mathspec
```

## 0.1.0rc1 (2026-09-25)

The release candidate for 0.1.0, the first release on PyPI:
`pip install mathspec==0.1.0rc1`. The package installs, imports and runs as
`mathspec` since 0.0.0-alpha.127
([#702](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/702)). The
`0.0.0-alpha.N` releases below were tags and GitHub releases only.

- docs: a page says how the package version and the language version of a model file relate ([#711](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/711))
- docs: the installation page and the PyPI project page say `pip install mathspec`, and the README's links resolve on PyPI ([#707](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/707))
- docs: every link to the documentation points at mathspec.readthedocs.io ([#706](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/pull/706))

### Refactoring

* the package installs, imports and runs as mathspec, rather than math-spec and math_spec ([#702](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/702)) ([f9151af](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/f9151af9d5977f8288fb64a12779b61597f12371))

### Documentation

* the site is built by zensical, and its API reference is the public surface rather than every module ([#568](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/568)) ([64eb268](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/64eb26894dcd5444f1cd65c7035abe4f5ccec252))

### Bug Fixes

* **language:** an unknown operator's refusal points at the limits page instead of an escape key that does not exist ([#676](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/676)) ([5e4ef2b](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/5e4ef2b8e6f397f71f9b09ab55685d6c02fe3a83))
* **language:** messages and docs say data is attached rather than bound, so a bound is only a variable's limit ([#694](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/694)) ([cc8ba08](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/cc8ba089ed50f746aae39d914ba3b7a8e700a267))

* each page keeps only what its reader needs, and a fact stated twice keeps one home ([#686](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/686)) ([ef8dcb9](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/ef8dcb9c71845a1a64c471406bd3a47ec8bc45af))
* engine authors get a program api page rendered from math_spec.program, and the per-module pages and the file-and-program page are gone ([#697](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/697)) ([784867a](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/784867a5db6df556001d58559b46cb5acf916055))
* one Python API page documents every public name, including the typesetting functions ([#679](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/679)) ([ee5ffdf](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/ee5ffdf58ade9d803aedb48cdfbc5c47f5dd625c))
* the nav keeps tutorials, how-to guides, reference and about for model writers, and puts the rest under development ([#683](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/683)) ([341ad2a](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/341ad2a768aea4808d579627d39ab9321f05bd78))
* the notation page heads each section with the construct it shows ([#682](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/682)) ([66faa7b](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/66faa7b24863eae2d170355a70bc6f1216dbaaa0))
* the readme and home page lead with what a user gets, and name specsolve and linopy as engines ([#698](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/698)) ([9fda1bc](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/9fda1bc9f967246db2e7f27a9e6c6432b7ffd686))
* the readme drops the internals diagram and the repeated formats, and is a third shorter ([#699](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/699)) ([234245b](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/234245b82427d046eb79e15955dc6ad34e578114))
* what spec.expand() returns is documented on the model writer's python api page, and reading.md keeps only which program an engine reads ([#696](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/696)) ([a9caeae](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/a9caeae7cbc07e18cdf5685e2234f31980afd746))
* what spec.expand() returns is stated once, as a different model that binds the same data ([#677](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/issues/677)) ([413550e](https://github.com/energy-models/mathspec/commit/413550e884fc1a31639c5518bf3f869edee18548))

### Refactoring

* **language:** a model loads without writing its curves out, and the program owns the vocabulary the file declares in ([#653](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/653)) ([7e93ecb](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/7e93ecbafce83bcce9144877f306fafc566a3f28))
* **language:** every rule that reads across declarations runs in lowering, before any expression is read ([#651](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/651)) ([6c1fb6b](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/6c1fb6b68dedfba64db5154283d35e20f4b0b350))

* **program:** a program carries the trees the typesetter prints, and every curve is written out before a model becomes one ([#649](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/649)) ([762394d](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/762394d01521323de919b8ae7cbc3598a28ea875))
* **program:** a program mirrors the file, descriptions and curves included, and the typesetter reads it alone ([#650](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/650)) ([bfd628e](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/bfd628e88e132639ce6569d5e0c9e3c8f0a05793))

### Bug Fixes

* **language:** a long chain of named expressions loads, a typo beside a formal is refused, and a fault in an entry hides no other ([#643](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/643)) ([1e010ca](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/1e010ca0f29994bd4b31099885d2696e3f7e979f))

### Features

* **program:** a model says whether an axis may be built a window at a time, and what each coordinate needs from its neighbours ([#374](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/374)) ([1e029b4](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/1e029b4637637e12a1dad12b7d5b6b127695cdc9))

### Bug Fixes

* an expression too deep to walk is refused rather than crashing ([#359](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/359)) ([d6cee25](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/d6cee25b37294993a6733723f256d28a140f63f2))

### Documentation

* **language:** only a dimension some declaration reaches needs a source ([#378](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/378)) ([b3b9549](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/b3b9549582a9976dafabd25ef203bc4353f4791c))

### Bug Fixes

* the docstrings no longer point a consumer at the package-private expression tree ([#351](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/351)) ([15b1985](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/15b1985e7660eadec0d5d6bfe1850fbb7b20733e))


### Refactoring

* the expression parser is package-private, and the parsed tree is named apart from the program's ([#342](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/342)) ([55ff525](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/55ff525f1dfacd7e93d6448adb0b377d09fa3e85))

### Documentation

* **language:** the rules binding obeys belong to the language, not to whichever engine reads the data ([#242](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/242)) ([c05da6a](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/c05da6a69d46ca0f595cfab4bd9e8eec827dfeb0))

### Refactoring

* a built-in's one positional argument is stated once, and a degree question names the tree it walks ([#364](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/364)) ([556af30](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/556af3053e0bb32ca8bf60e656b9455b98068981))
* every rule two passes shared has one home, and a docstring says what a caller needs rather than why ([#363](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/363)) ([f24ddd3](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/f24ddd3089da12aa75715560992822a5a3ee818b))
* **model:** each cross-declaration rule is one method, so a refusal names the rule that raised it ([#369](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/369)) ([b25a602](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/b25a602d21a6bb91d597f663f8bcf0b97f95aed8))
* **piecewise:** one block expands itself, holding its names, frame and mask once ([#367](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/367)) ([537eadf](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/537eadf76f52615c83235e0dfbbdd2af5fa70588))
* resolution is one method per node kind, and each operator's dim rule is one function ([#368](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/368)) ([c7c2833](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/c7c283347869fbd45e0ff851d0112bfcbc09f98c))
* **typesetting:** the legend reads what the equations returned rather than state left on the walk ([#366](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/366)) ([db96a54](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/db96a54d55996a9e4cc89a3f837303149475211b))

### Performance

* a model loads, lowers and typesets three to eight times faster ([#357](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/357)) ([ea6fe79](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/ea6fe798c85118750294b642463b16aa0935065f))

### Refactoring

* **language:** a translation policy and a bound's side name the values they can be, rather than being a string ([#354](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/354)) ([d212157](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/d2121572496bf7e624cfa5e38c348cfbed4b71ad))
* **typesetting:** a format spells the operators the language names, rather than any string a walk happens to ask for ([#352](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/352)) ([12b4041](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/12b404126dbe00e28ad16b4736dbe90dfda833d0))

### Features

* **parser:** a refused where string names the rewrite for pandas and C connective habits ([#346](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/346)) ([3dbd9b2](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/3dbd9b261dd82fc5cd52924ecdd03b18ddd88c14))

### Refactoring

* **language:** an operator, a declaration kind and a notation name the values they can be, rather than being a string ([#345](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/345)) ([3f3f858](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/3f3f8581baabc51882ad4e1d97fb774ae1944dc3))

### Bug Fixes

* **language:** a declaration named what no expression could write is refused, rather than loading unreferenceable ([#340](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/340)) ([b865bc1](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/b865bc15fde7e5a7714cdf809f5f0b9e6e6f44e5))

### Performance

* **program:** a mask walks its leaves once and every question reads that walk ([#338](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/338)) ([337d169](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/337d1697724980356c8d911bf21242a19a6f517a))

### Bug Fixes

* **language:** the language reference states which case arms are refused, and the refusal says what actually breaks ([#336](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/336)) ([01920d1](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/01920d1be4f6dbd6965f6f0e7e683543384cc744))

### Features

* **program:** a resolved where is a first-class Mask whose leaves carry their dims, and the where grammar is package-private ([#327](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/327)) ([53cc352](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/53cc3522e917a5849ce3150585c2c9e05a8ea162))

### Bug Fixes

* **program:** a program describes a mathematical program rather than being one, and claims neither linearity nor a storage format ([#315](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/315)) ([5dfa6be](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/5dfa6be817fb49999571b2fdc8b8b820371f80d0))

### Features

* **program:** the conjuncts of a where mask are the program's to give, not each consumer's to re-derive ([#313](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/313)) ([db63d3c](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/db63d3ca90079e4031a9339ea7749c0567b31be9))

### Documentation

* **ceiling:** load-time unit checking has its own refusal, where the data-prep row used to answer for it ([#272](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/272)) ([8dfd17d](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/8dfd17df17993f1209fe479734c3dee756fcc384))

### Documentation

* drop the effects row from the PyPSA-1.3.0 parity table, a feature that release does not have ([#305](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/305)) ([92e5ed8](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/92e5ed84c14c59e8068a7814722950f936e2925a))

### Documentation

* a link's delivery lags its flow, wrapping or losing what is in transit at the horizon's edge ([#300](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/300)) ([1d4f10f](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/1d4f10fce6ef9889400caddd0cf0436ab2b07c53))

### Documentation

* **examples:** the PyPSA file states a constraint once where PyPSA builds one row set, rather than a block per regime ([#257](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/257)) ([#292](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/292)) ([c35e637](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/c35e637c8632e361d1d9565824e0497d3199bc16))

### Documentation

* **language:** a label space may group a position, though not a reduction or a walk ([#281](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/281)) ([00be0cb](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/00be0cb9bca7bc3f73860a50fe703d6eefff3be6))

### Features

* **examples:** a link delivers to as many buses as its data declares, not two ([#273](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/273)) ([0ece0d8](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/0ece0d86794a86664e2596428df25e319eb6b56e))


### Bug Fixes

* **examples:** a committable modular unit that is not extendable gets the rows PyPSA builds for it ([#271](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/271)) ([5af0ac8](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/5af0ac8cb15271c4b6982e4397604fe3dfb5cb10))

### Features

* **language:** which dims a mask reads is the language's answer, so two consumers cannot restrict one model differently ([#269](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/269)) ([350b1ed](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/350b1ed5b572146f8168297e6ded1a234c6fc619))

### Features

* **program:** a piecewise assumption names the data it is about, and a derived parameter says how it is filled ([#237](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/237)) ([48431b1](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/48431b1a72197570ab291103267212d269141936))

### Bug Fixes

* **language:** a negative edge fill prints, the sign of a literal amount being folded once at resolution ([#234](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/234)) ([d9303db](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/d9303dbd1e824f674331b7e9403dd5799444dd15))

### Features

* **program:** a parameter says which piecewise block derived it, and a label space keeps its dtype ([#227](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/227)) ([515dbd5](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/515dbd5054dae8ae61fd8818be4d204e1d98950b))
* **program:** a piecewise block is kept as facts — its breakpoints, its mask, and what it assumes of the data ([#228](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/228)) ([2fdbd6f](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/2fdbd6f5760975132f0dc9db605b11f4d2cc7103))

* **program:** a program's declarations are keyed by the name the file wrote ([#205](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/205)) ([579264a](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/579264a6b69557ab840edf38dace462e10b6715e))
* **program:** drop the two pieces of the program API nothing reaches ([#204](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/204)) ([ca25fa5](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/ca25fa5433540d45b73bc9fe307eeca78bc47376))
* **program:** expressions are the ones a row is built from, and the declared ones say so ([#206](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/206)) ([81aaddd](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/81aaddd655a8db6676f4f87c073908f6c0340a16))
* **program:** the program module says what it promises, rather than offering its whole namespace ([#208](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/208)) ([08d2f64](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/08d2f644f1975aca0a3eb4927e034c402e6d46eb))

### Features

* a model is checked from the shell, advice included, with no consumer installed ([#192](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/192)) ([941126c](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/941126cd95af7decb0d37538e93c4f7c4ad54935))
* advice carries which pass said it and which declaration it is about, so a consumer can filter rather than parse ([#195](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/195)) ([89408f6](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/89408f6fae500df661bda66cc2f0ef100b691636))


### Refactoring

* one call returns every note the language can give without data ([#191](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/191)) ([2face7a](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/2face7a39092e5f2fc1ddb705efee8a7d34dd343))

### Refactoring

* a program is trusted by construction, so the language's rules are checked once, on the spec ([#189](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/189)) ([45931b1](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/45931b1a975d80faa45ad47303fdbb30b1f12855))

### Refactoring

* two public states and a conversion to each, where the surface was seventy-seven names ([#180](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/180)) ([718e2de](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/718e2dea7c6e05933c4880196279ae9fe015dd09))

### Features

* the notes a check prints are reachable, so a consumer surfaces them rather than re-deriving them ([#184](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/184)) ([19ef814](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/19ef81411b619ae187f7763338202e1e06401cf0))

### Features

* a program is the second public state, and one call reaches it ([#177](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/177)) ([c9ee1ab](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/c9ee1ab2607fce5618a4b3df56082d9ec1b2b3a5))

### Documentation

* **agents:** the cheap gates run here, and CI is reported rather than watched ([#175](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/175)) ([78e3d80](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/78e3d80e0705238296a90e9eed3ecf182f737e2c))

### Features

* **language:** dimension members and lookup maps come from the data, rather than from the file ([#169](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/169)) ([f3c4e5f](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/f3c4e5fa492ece1ae0af1ac27e7b0a36266a287a))

### Bug Fixes

* the ac-dc-meshed rung states its network, so the reference run needs no download ([#166](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/166)) ([abf734c](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/abf734c8cd294935907455048a39da585cca56e1))

### Bug Fixes

* the linearized rung states its three caps as rows and starts one unit cold, so every block it declares is built ([#162](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/162)) ([cb4863f](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/cb4863f35f71a97c44703390335121200273a4f6))

### Features

* a snapshot is a timestamp, in the file and in every rung's network ([#159](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/159)) ([dd5122e](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/dd5122ec2184bdaf3145e56949e42a6fa0612948))

### Documentation

* **language:** the absence page is half the length and shows each rule on a model ([#127](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/127)) ([147788a](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/147788af0d8f912ed3442e56392b3ef3e994a7ed))

### Refactoring

* **parser:** one number rule, one amount table, and a namespace nothing builds by hand ([#106](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/106)) ([f775a07](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/f775a07cf8f5159dd8df973f995b8dad87fd01ef))

### Bug Fixes

* **language:** a link takes any affine expression, an uncalled template hides no typo, and degree is decided at load ([#91](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/91)) ([a653056](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/a6530562d59b4ac134ef4fd051ae1c9aea5f1b2c))
* **parser:** a negation is over a power, a keyword is given once, and an amount is a number or a name ([#88](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/88)) ([4bf994c](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/4bf994ce4700b634e970b49e8e10e705c479a65f))

* **typeset:** a sum under its own dimension takes a fresh index, and prose escapes its markup ([#92](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/issues/92)) ([20c7076](https://github.com/energy-models/math-spec/commit/20c7076511c5a3ef74dc06fe0d11888f292f1b2d))

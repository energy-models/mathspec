description: House rules for writing documentation prose in this project — what a page is for, how it is shaped, and the sentence-level bar. Use when writing a new documentation page or section, or when adding prose to an existing one.

# Writing docs here

These are the rules a page has to meet. They apply to prose you write now and
to prose already on the page: a page that does not meet them is not finished,
whoever wrote it.

The reader knows the domain — optimisation models, YAML, a bit of maths — and
knows nothing about this project. Write for that person.

## The voice

Plain, direct, professional. Explain to a smart adult who does not work on
this project. They are not stupid, they are unfamiliar.

- **Say the answer first**, then why. A section that builds to its point makes
  the reader hold everything until the end.
- **Short sentences, short words.** "Use" not "utilise", "before" not "prior
  to", "so" not "in order that". A term the language owns — `piecewise`, a
  coordinate, a `where`, a macro — is never swapped for a plainer word, but
  everything around it is.
- **Snappy is short, not clipped.** A four-word fragment that costs a re-read
  is worse than the ten-word sentence it replaced.
- **Confident and flat.** State the rule. Do not hedge with "generally",
  "typically", "in most cases" unless the exception is real, and then name the
  exception instead.
- **No enthusiasm, no marketing.** No "powerful", "seamless", "elegant",
  "simply", "just", "of course", "as you can see", "note that". Each of these
  either tells the reader their confusion is their fault, or says nothing.
- **No jokes and no asides.** A reader hitting this page is stuck, and reads
  it in a hurry.
- **No apology and no warning voice.** "Unfortunately", "be careful",
  "beware" — say what happens and what to write instead.
- **One spelling convention per page.** The tree is mixed and this skill does
  not settle it: match the page you are on.

## 1. Decide what the page is before writing a sentence

Two questions decide it, and they work on a paragraph as well as a page:

1. Does it inform **action** or **cognition**?
2. Does it serve **acquiring** a skill or **applying** one?

| Kind        | Informs   | Serves  | Answers                                               | Section · folder                                                 |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tutorial    | action    | acquire | "Get me a first file that loads and prints"           | Tutorials · `docs/`                                              |
| How-to      | action    | apply   | "I have this task"                                    | How-to guides · `docs/howto/`                                    |
| Reference   | cognition | apply   | "What exactly does X accept, and what does it print?" | Reference · `docs/reference/`, example pages in `docs/examples/` |
| Explanation | cognition | acquire | "Why is it like this?"                                | About · `docs/about/`                                            |

The nav and the tree are both arranged by kind, for someone who writes a
spec. A new page goes in the folder of its kind and under the nav section of
the same name. The example pages sit at the end of the Reference section, after
the pages a reader looks things up in. A worked example is neither a tutorial
nor a how-to: it teaches no path and names no task, it shows that the language
says a spec.

The Development section, last in the nav, holds every page a spec writer does
not need, in three groups:

- **Building on mathspec** is for someone who writes a tool against `Spec`
  and `Program`: an engine such as specsolve, a renderer, a checker.
- **Contributing** is for someone who changes mathspec itself.
- **Proofs of concept** holds the notation page, which renders the typesetting
  test spec, and the PyPSA pages. The PyPSA pages stay in `docs/examples/`,
  where `tools/gallery.py` writes them.

A page in Development keeps the folder of its kind.

Each kind has one job, and one thing it must not do:

- **A tutorial is a lesson.** One path, every step shows a result, and the
  reader finishes with a file that loads and prints. It explains nothing and
  offers no choice: a choice is a how-to leaking in.
- **A how-to is a recipe.** The title names the goal, the body is the steps,
  and the reader is assumed competent. It neither teaches nor explains.
- **Reference describes, and only describes.** One consistent format, and a
  structure that mirrors what it describes: the language pages follow the
  file's keys, the typeset page follows the three formats and their options.
  No rationale, no instruction.
- **Explanation is the one place for why.** Context, alternatives and opinion
  live here and nowhere else, within what `AGENTS.md` sends to the PR.

**An example page is reference in its own form.** It answers "can the language
say my model, and what does the file mean?", and its shape is a witness rather
than a table: a paragraph of the page's own, then the file verbatim and the
math the typesetter prints from it. The block is written by `tools/gallery.py`
between `<!-- gallery:begin -->` and `<!-- gallery:end -->`; the paragraph is
the only prose on the page, and it says what the spec is and the one or two
things worth reading for, which the `description:` line in the file does not.
The PyPSA pages, in the Development section, add a generated block per rung,
holding the reference script and what PyPSA solved it to. Every example is a
file under `examples/`, loaded by the suite and compiled by the LaTeX gate,
and `tests/test_docs.py` holds each block to its generator byte for byte. The catalogue in
`docs/examples/index.md` is hand-written: one bullet per page in the Examples
section, saying why a reader would open it.

**The Python API is rendered from the docstrings.**
`docs/reference/api.md` holds one `:::` entry per name in `mathspec.__all__`,
for a spec writer. `docs/reference/program.md` renders `mathspec.program`,
for whoever builds on the program. mkdocstrings renders both from the
docstrings, so their prose is the docstring rules in `AGENTS.md`. No other
module gets a page: an internal module is read in the source.

Mixing kinds is the most common failure. Rationale inside a reference section
makes the rules unskimmable, and rules inside an explanation page make the
argument unreadable. Most rationale belongs in the PR, per `AGENTS.md`; what
survives into an explanation page is the part a user needs to make decisions.

The language is documented here and only here. A page says what a file may
contain, what it means, what the loader refuses, and what the typesetter
prints from it. What a consumer does with a spec — the data it attaches, how it
solves, what it reads back — is that consumer's page, not this tree's
([what counts as language](../../../docs/about/what-counts-as-language.md)).
A rule about a consumer says only what the file guarantees it
([reading a spec and its program](../../../docs/reference/reading.md)).

Answer the two questions before starting. If a page needs two kinds, it is
two sections with two headings, or two pages.

## 2. Open with the purpose

One sentence, above the first rule, saying what the page is for and who needs
it. No throat-clearing, no restating the title, no "in this section we will".

Then the shape a reader needs, in this order:

1. **Shape** — the smallest thing they can write that works.
2. **Rules** — what is accepted, and what is refused.
3. **Rationale** — only where it changes what they write.

The subtlest rule gets the most support: a list, a worked example, a table.
The obvious rule gets one sentence.

## 3. Every rule carries an example, and the example is real

- **Show the input and its result side by side.** YAML next to the maths it
  renders, a call next to its output. Never in a later subsection.
- **Every generated block is checked; a hand-written fence is not.** The
  spec on an example page, the notation page, the operator table and the
  home spec come from a generator, and `tests/test_docs.py` holds them to
  it. `reading.md` is run by `tests/test_reading_page.py`, which checks every
  `expression  # value` line. The `NAME` production on the expressions page
  is compared to the parser's. A YAML fence anywhere else is read by nothing,
  so load it before committing: write it to a file and run
  `pixi run python -m mathspec check spec.yaml`. Write the fragment as a
  whole spec where the page allows it; a fragment that cannot stand alone is
  one the reader cannot run either.
- **Quote error messages whole.** This language's messages name the rewrite,
  and a truncated quote drops exactly the half that teaches.
- **Prefer the smallest example that still shows the point.** A spec with two
  dimensions and one variable teaches; a realistic one hides the rule in
  scenery.
- **Show the refused form too**, where the refusal is the lesson, with the
  message it produces.

## 4. Headings are the table of contents

- **Topic nouns, sentence case.** "Quadratic expressions", not "Degree 2 in
  the math, degree 1 beside it". The test: a reader who types the subject into
  the search box should land on this heading.
- **Never a conclusion the reader cannot parse yet.** A heading is read before
  the section, so it cannot depend on it.
- **A heading names a subject. It does not narrate one.** "Solver capability",
  not "What a solver can take is a separate question". "Unknown keys", not "An
  unknown key is refused". A heading that argues, concludes or tells a small
  story is the section leaking upward: put the claim in the first sentence,
  where the reader can act on it.
- **No second clause after a comma or a dash.** "Two states, and the difference
  between them" carries a heading and an aside. Keep the heading.
- **One `##` per idea.** A section that needs a paragraph of preamble before
  its first rule is two sections.

## 5. Bold lead-ins are the skim layer

A reader who reads only the bold lead-ins of a list must come away correct and
complete. Write them that way deliberately: each is a claim, not a label.

```markdown
- **Absence spreads through arithmetic.** A sum with one absent term is absent.
```

not

```markdown
- **Arithmetic.** ...
```

## 6. Vocabulary

- **Gloss house vocabulary at first use** — _spec_, _program_, _declaration_,
  _dimension_, _coordinate_, _frame_, _relation_, _absence_, _macro_, _named
  expression_, _reported expression_. One clause with a concrete
  instance: "one point of it, one generator in one snapshot, is a coordinate".
- **A file states a spec; a model is a spec with data.** Write "model" only
  for what an engine builds and a solver takes, never for the file or the
  `Spec` in hand ([glossary](../../../docs/reference/glossary.md)).
- **Gloss every acronym and domain term at first use**, in parentheses, six
  words or fewer.
- **One word per concept, for the whole page.** _dims_, _dimensions_ and
  _axis_ are three words, and a reader counts three ideas. Vary nothing for
  rhythm.
- **No overloaded words** — do not write "the case in point" beside a `cases:`
  keyword.
- **Gloss where the term is used**, and link the reference page that owns it
  rather than redefine it. The ten-rules table on the
  [language index](../../../docs/reference/language/index.md) says which page
  owns which rule; a second definition drifts.
- **Link the reference section at a construct's first mention** on the page.
  A construct links to its page under `docs/reference/language/`; a verb —
  `to_spec`, `to_latex` — links to `docs/reference/typeset.md` or the API
  page.

## 7. Sentences

The bar, and it is checkable:

1. **One idea per sentence.** Median at or under 20 words; over 25 is where a
   newcomer re-reads.
2. **Active voice, with a real subject.** "The loader refuses it before any
   data is attached", not "the refusal comes before any data is attached". An abstract
   noun as subject is the single biggest reason technical prose reads
   expert-only.
3. **State the rule in things, then in abstractions.** "One generator at one
   snapshot cannot have two previous statuses" before "two values at one
   coordinate is not a quantity".
4. **Address the reader for what they do.** "Close such a hole in one of three
   ways". A rule about the language is about the language, not about "the
   modeller".
5. **A full stop, not an em dash, between two independent clauses.** Both
   halves having a subject and a verb is the test. Keep the dash for an aside
   inside one clause, and use few.
6. **Every sentence has a subject and a finite verb.** A paragraph never opens
   on a title-like fragment: "Grammar first, which is usually free because
   `f(x, k=v)` already parses" is a caption, not a sentence. Write "Start with
   the grammar, which is usually free". A heading already labels the section, so
   a label under it says nothing twice.
7. **A colon or a dash does not excuse a missing verb.** "The probes: for each
   operator, the smallest spec that declares it, beside the equation it
   renders" is three noun phrases and no claim. So is "A dispatch spec with a
   start-up ramp — the formulation `cases:` exists for", which closes on a
   stranded preposition. Say who does what: "Each probe declares one operator in
   the smallest spec that can, and prints the equation beside it."
8. **No fronted participles** that suspend the subject: "Having no mask to
   narrow its frame, it is the one that…".
9. **No elided possessives**: "The dims of a cased one cannot", not "A cased
   one's cannot".
10. **A pronoun names its subject again** once a clause has intervened.
11. **No double negatives, no metaphor stacked on metaphor, no relative clauses
    stacked without _that_.**
12. **Say it once.** The same claim in three paragraphs is load-bearing in
    none.

Measure before committing, and put the numbers in the commit body. The number
is evidence, not a target: a list-shaped sentence may be long and clear.

## 8. What does not go on the page

- **History.** "Previously this used to…", "renamed from…" — that is git.
- **Argument for a settled decision.** That is the PR.
- **A promise about the future.** "Will support…" ages into a lie.
- **Anything that duplicates another page.** One fact, one home; link instead.
  A second copy drifts silently. The README is pulled into `docs/index.md` as
  snippets, so a sentence that appears on both is edited once, in the README.
- **A rule of an engine.** How data is attached to a spec, how it is solved, or read back
  is a consumer's page. Here a consumer is named only for what the file
  guarantees it.
- **Generated content.** The spec and its math on every example page and the
  rung blocks on the PyPSA pages (`tools/gallery.py`), the table on
  `docs/reference/notation.md` (`tools/notation.py`), the operator table on
  `docs/reference/language/operators.md` (`tools/spec_math.py`), and the home
  spec on `docs/index.md` and in the README (`tools/home_math.py`) are
  written by a tool between `<!-- …:begin -->` and `<!-- …:end -->` markers.
  Change the generator, then read the diff. `tests/test_docs.py`'s
  `GENERATED` table is the list.

## 9. Mechanics

- **A new page needs a nav entry in `mkdocs.yml`.** The docs build is
  `--strict`, so a dead cross-link and a stale anchor fail it. A page with no
  nav entry does not fail the build — zensical validates links and leaves
  navigation alone — so `pixi run test` is what reports it, in
  `tests/test_docs.py`.
- **A new page carries the SPDX header** — `mathspec contributors`,
  `CC-BY-4.0` — in an HTML comment at the top, or as YAML comments inside the
  front matter where the page has one, as `docs/index.md` does. `reuse lint`
  is part of `pixi run lint`.
- **Inside `docs/`, link relatively; outside it, write the full GitHub URL.**
  A relative link above `docs/` renders in the repo and fails the strict
  build. Anchors follow GitHub's slug rules on the site too, so an anchor that
  works in the repo works on the site.
- **A card body is indented four spaces**, under `<!-- prettier-ignore -->`,
  or the card falls out of its list and `tests/test_docs.py` says so.
- **A generated block lands with its plumbing**: the page in
  `.prettierignore`, with a comment naming the tool, and the tool in
  `tests/test_docs.py`'s `GENERATED` table.
- **A diagram carries alt text**, and no rule is stated in colour alone.
- **Tables for what varies along one axis** — accepted keys, the operators,
  the formats. Prose for what has an order or a reason.

## 10. Gates

```bash
pixi run docs-build                                               # --strict, so a dead anchor is a failure
pixi run pytest tests/test_docs.py tests/test_reading_page.py -q  # the generated blocks, and the page that is run
pixi run lint                                                     # prettier, typos, reuse
```

`pixi run compile-tex` too when a file under `examples/` changed. Say which
gate ran and what was left unrun.

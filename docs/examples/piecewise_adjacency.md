# A curve that is not convex

The same dispatch model, with a curve that bends both ways. Nothing about the
objective now keeps the weights on one segment, so the method builds the
restriction out of binaries. `adjacency` is the default, and this is what it
costs.

Compare the math with [the convex page](piecewise.md). A second variable
appears, `cost_curve_seg`, one binary per segment. Two rows come with it:
`cost_curve_pick` picks exactly one segment, and `cost_curve_adjacency` holds
each weight under the segments it borders. The link rows and the convexity row
are unchanged.

The same least-cost dispatch as `piecewise.yaml`, with a cost curve that is not convex. The weights need binaries to hold them on one segment, which is what the default method builds.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — dispatchable units |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bp` — breakpoints of the cost curve |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{capacity}`$ | `capacity` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — maximum dispatch |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T}`$ — demand to be met |
| $`\mathrm{x}`$ | `bp_x` over $`\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — breakpoint dispatch levels, one curve per generator |
| $`\mathrm{y}`$ | `bp_y` over $`\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — cost at each breakpoint, one curve per generator |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathit{dispatch}`$ | `dispatch` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — dispatched power |
| $`\mathit{op\_cost}`$ | `op_cost` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — operating cost, piecewise-linear in dispatch |

Upright is what the data supplies — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{capacity}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`\mathit{dispatch}`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g}
```

#### Subject to

**`balance`**

```math
\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{dispatch}_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T}
```

**`cost_curve`**

```math
\left( \mathit{dispatch}_{t,g},\ \mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g} \right) \in \mathrm{pwl}_{b \in \mathcal{B}}(\mathrm{x}_{g,b},\ \mathrm{y}_{g,b}) \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

#### Variable domains

**`dispatch`**

```math
0 \le \mathit{dispatch}_{t,g} \le \mathrm{capacity}_{g} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`op_cost`**

```math
\mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

#### Assumptions

**`cost_curve_complete`**

```math
\mathrm{x}_{g,b} \text{ is defined} \wedge \mathrm{y}_{g,b} \text{ is defined} \qquad \forall\, g \in \mathcal{G},\ b \in \mathcal{B}
```

# Processes

One of the [24 fragments](index.md) of `examples/pypsa.yaml`: PyPSA's `Process`. It adds a term to `tech_capacity_expansion`, `scenario_opex`, `total_cost`, `Carrier_additions`, `Bus_injection`. It reads `CVaR_omega`, `Process_committable`, `Process_maintenance`, `Process_maintenance_capacity`, `Process_maintenance_pu`, `period_weight_objective` and 2 more under [`given`](../../reference/language/declarations.md#given).

| $`\alpha`$ | `Process_rate` over $`\Xi \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{R}`$ — the energy a port draws or delivers per unit of internal power, PyPSA's `rate0`, `rate1`, … read long — negative where the port withdraws, positive where it injects; a link is a process whose `bus0` rate is minus one and whose output rates are its efficiencies. Read at the snapshot the transfer arrives, so a delayed port transfers at its arrival snapshot's rate (`constraints.py:1498`) |
| $`\mathrm{d}^{z}`$ | `Process_output_delay` over $`\mathcal{R}`$ — snapshots a port's transfer lags its process's internal power — PyPSA's `delay0`, `delay1`, … read long, in `snapshot_weightings.generators` units, which the file states as whole snapshots; zero for a port that transfers at once. The same in every scenario, as a link's |
| $`\mathrm{cyc}^{z}`$ | `Process_output_cyclic_delay` over $`\mathcal{R}`$ — whether a delayed port's transfer wraps from the end of its investment period — PyPSA's `cyclic_delay0`, `cyclic_delay1`, …; where it does not, the energy still in transit at each period's first snapshots is lost.

| $`\mathrm{z}^{\mathrm{nom,set}}`$ | `Process_p_nom_set` over $`\mathcal{J}`$ — a given nominal power for an extendable process; one without a value has no row here |

PyPSA refuses a fixed modular build whose nominal power is not a whole number of modules |
| $`\mathrm{nonneg}^{z}`$ | `Process_p_min_pu_nonneg` over $`\mathcal{J}`$ — true where none of the process's own minimums-per-unit is negative — PyPSA's per-unit `(p_min_pu >= 0).all()` over every snapshot and scenario, data prep |
| $`\mathrm{on}^{z}`$ | `Process_active` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{J}`$ — whether a process stands in a snapshot's period — PyPSA's `active`, data prep |
| $`\mathrm{W}^{z}`$ | `Process_capital_weight` over $`\mathcal{J}`$ — the sum of period weights a process stands in — PyPSA's `active * period_weighting`, summed, data prep |

| $`\mathrm{m}^{z}`$ | `Process_tech_capacity_weight` over $`\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{J}`$ — one where the process is in the row's carrier-and-bus set — data prep; one outside it, or one that does not stand in the row's `investment_period`, has no row |

| $`Z`$ | `Process_p_nom_ext` over $`\mathcal{J}`$ — `Process-p_nom` — nominal internal power where it is a decision; the parameter of the same PyPSA name carries the fixed regime |

$`t \ominus k`$ denotes cyclic translation: index $`t-k`$ taken modulo the size of the dimension (`roll`). Plain $`t-k`$ (`shift`) has no wraparound — terms translated past the edge are simply absent.

$`t \boxminus_{v} k`$ denotes translation with $`v`$ standing where index $`t-k`$ leaves the dimension (`shift(edge=v)`), so the row at that boundary is built and carries $`v`$ rather than being dropped.

$`t \ominus^{\mathrm{relation}(t)} k`$ denotes a translation counted inside the group a relation puts $`t`$ in (`shift(within=relation[c])`), so a term never crosses out of its own group. The two modifiers take different slots — the group above, the fill below — so $`t \boxminus_{v}^{\mathrm{relation}(t)} k`$ is both at once.

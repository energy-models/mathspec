# PyPSA in 24 files

[PyPSA in one file](../pypsa.md) is `examples/pypsa.yaml`, one spec of some
four thousand lines. This is the same spec as 24 files under
`examples/pypsa/`, one per topic, and `merge` gives the one file back: the
two have one [canonical form](../../howto/compare.md).

Every fragment loads, prints and gets advice on its own. What it reads and does
not declare, it states under
[`given`](../../reference/language/declarations.md#given). A component that
puts something into a sum every component adds to, such as the bus balance or
the operating cost, names its share as an expression of its own and adds it
with a [`term`](../../reference/language/declarations.md#a-term-a-file-adds).
One fragment declares each sum as an
[empty sum](../../reference/language/named.md#expressions), `empty: true`, so a
term always lands. A new component is one new file, and the network does
not change.

The split is written by `tools/pypsa_split.py` from the one file and checked
against it, so the two cannot drift. It is a proof of concept: a decision on
which of the two is the source comes after both land.

## What each file says

Three kinds of file. A **component** owns PyPSA's class of that name: its
dimension, its data, its columns, its rows, and its share of each sum. The
committable classes, `Generator`, `Link` and `Process`, are cut by feature into
a file each for the class, its commitment, its ramping and its maintenance,
and the three sets read alike because PyPSA's rows do. An **owner** declares
a sum as `empty: true` over its frame, and the row that reads it: the network
declares `Bus_injection`, power flow declares `Cycle_angle_sum`. **Settings**
holds what every topic reads, the weightings and the flags, and declares the
totals whose own readers, the cost, the carriers and the global constraints, a
model may leave out.

## Leaving a file out

A model may leave a component family out, or the cost, the carriers, the
global constraints or security, and what is left is a whole model: nothing
stays under `given:`. It may not leave the network or power flow out while a
component is in, because the component's terms would land on no name, and
`merge` says so.

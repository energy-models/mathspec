# Settings

One of the [24 fragments](index.md) of `examples/pypsa.yaml`: the weightings, the risk preference and the flags every topic reads. It reads the eight totals whose readers may be left out, `total_cost`, `scenario_opex`, `Carrier_additions` and the five global-constraint sums, under `given:`, so the terms the components add to them always have a reader. It sets the objective, which reads `total_cost`.

      PyPSA's `investment_period_weightings.years` — what a period's energy

      `transmission_losses` read as a flag; its mode, tangents or secants,
      only decides how data prep fills the `segment` axis, the rows are the
      same; false with no segments is a lossless run. A security-constrained
      run over a network with passive branches builds no loss: PyPSA does not
      hand the keyword to `create_model` (`abstract.py:437-441`) but to the
      solver (`:491`), so data prep feeds false there

      names one, data prep. A row that names a period the run does not model
      has no label here, as PyPSA skips it (`global_constraints.py:377`);

      description: >-
        what an `operational_limit` row totals — the weighted energy its

        folded into the row's constant

        snapshot's hours and its period, before the scenario's own weight; a
        start and a stop cost what they cost, unweighted, as PyPSA adds them
        (`optimize.py:414-429`)
    total_cost:
      dims: []
      description: >-
        what the system costs — capacity once per active period at its expected
        cost over the scenarios, operation in expectation over the scenarios,
        and a share of it at the tail
    Carrier_additions:
      dims: [period, carrier]
      description: >-
        what a carrier adds in a period — every extendable component of that
        carrier, counting each build in the first period it stands in. Like
        PyPSA, it sums only the components that carry a carrier attribute, so a
        transformer, which has none, counts in no carrier

| $`\mathrm{w}^{\mathrm{yr}}`$ | `period_weight_years` over $`\mathcal{Y}`$ — PyPSA's `investment_period_weightings.years` — what a period's energy weighs in a `primary_energy` or `operational_limit` row; PyPSA reads it only under `multi_investment_periods`, so data prep feeds one otherwise |

| $`\mathrm{lossy}`$ | `transmission_losses` (scalar) — whether the network dissipates transmission losses — PyPSA's `transmission_losses` read as a flag; its mode, tangents or secants, only decides how data prep fills the `segment` axis, the rows are the same; false with no segments is a lossless run. A security-constrained run over a network with passive branches builds no loss: PyPSA does not hand the keyword to `create_model` (`abstract.py:437-441`) but to the solver (`:491`), so data prep feeds false there |

# Examples

Each page here shows one whole spec as the file and as the math it prints.
Every spec is a file under `examples/` in the repository.

- [Least-cost dispatch](dispatch.md) is the smallest whole spec. It has a
  balance, a bound and a cost to minimise.
- [Unit commitment](commitment.md) adds a start-up ramp. One quantity is defined
  by region, so a single inequality covers both regimes.
- [One construct per spec](operators.md) declares each operator in the smallest
  file that can, and prints the equation beside it.
- [A component library](library/index.md) is several files that compose into
  one spec. Each file reads the coupling surface and prints on its own, and the
  composed page shows what `merge` returns.

The PyPSA parity pages, from [PyPSA in one file](pypsa.md) on, are a proof of
concept. They sit in the Development section.

[Typeset the math](../reference/typeset.md) prints your own.

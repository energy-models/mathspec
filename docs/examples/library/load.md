# Loads

PyPSA's `Load`, and the fragment that shows what a file may leave out. It
declares no variable and no objective. `Load_p_set` is data, and the only thing
the file says is what the load's port withdraws.

The minus sign is the whole of its relation to the sign convention. A
withdrawal is a negative injection.

PyPSA's `Load`, wired to a port rather than straight to a bus. What it takes is data, so it decides nothing.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{J}`$ | index $`j`$ — `port` with $`\mathrm{Load\_port}: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{J}`$ — the connections components make, one label per connection |
| $`\mathcal{D}`$ | index $`d`$ — `load` with $`\mathrm{Load\_port}: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{J}`$ — demands, each on one port |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `Load_p_set` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{D}`$ — `Load-p_set` — what a load takes in a snapshot |

#### Given

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`f`$ | `Port_p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{J}`$ — the surface introduces this flow, and this file pins it at its own ports |

#### Subject to

**`Load_withdrawal`**

```math
f_{t,\mathrm{Load\_port}(d)} = -\mathrm{load}_{t,d} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ d \in \mathcal{D}
```

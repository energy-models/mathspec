# What counts as language

Several tools read the same spec file. An engine attaches data, builds the
model and hands it to a solver. A renderer prints the spec as equations. A
checker reads the spec in CI with no data. This page says which decisions the
language makes for all of them, and which each tool makes for itself.

The test is one question:

> If two tools answered this differently, would the file have two meanings?

Suppose the engine sums `p` over `generator` and the renderer prints a sum over
`snapshot`. The file now means two things, and that is a bug. So the language
decides what `sum(p, over=generator)` means, and both tools read the answer
instead of working it out.

Suppose instead that the engine writes the model in one solver's file format and
the renderer sets the page width to 80 characters. They disagree, and nothing is
wrong. Each tool decides those things for itself.

Four rules follow from the test:

- A name means one thing. `p` cannot be a variable in the engine and a parameter
  in the renderer.
- The set of operators is fixed. A tool cannot add a `roll` that the others
  do not know.
- Each operator has one rule for the dimensions it produces. `sum(p, by=gen_bus, over=generator, into=bus)`
  lands on `bus` for every program.
- Degree is decided when the file loads. Whether `x * y` is allowed does not
  depend on which engine builds the model.

A `piecewise:` block and a `sos:` block each state ordinary variables and
constraints, so the language decides what they state, and
[`spec.expand()`](../reference/language/piecewise.md#writing-a-formulation-out)
writes it out the same way for every tool.

## What each tool decides for itself

A tool can refuse a spec for a reason of its own. One engine can only take
a literal offset in `shift`. Another has no concept of a special-ordered set. A
file format has no way to write a quadratic constraint. None of these is a
disagreement about what the file means, so none of them is the language's to
settle. If the language refused everything one tool cannot build, every
other tool would inherit that limit.

So the boundary runs both ways:

- A tool must not invent a rule about what the file _means_. If it needs
  one, the rule goes into the language, once.
- The language must not state a rule about what one tool can _build_.

[The limits](limits.md) say which operators and blocks may be added to the
language at all.

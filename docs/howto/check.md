# Check a spec without data

Refuse a broken spec file before any data or solver is involved, on your
machine and in CI.

1. **Run the check on one file.**

   ```bash
   python -m mathspec check spec.yaml
   ```

   A refusal prints its message on stderr and exits with status 1:

   ```text
   variables.p: unknown key 'boundz' in a variable declaration. Did you mean 'bounds'?
   ```

   Advice prints on stdout and exits with status 0. A spec the language
   accepts with nothing to advise prints nothing.

   ```text
   Variable 'slack' makes this spec unbounded: no constraint names it, and bounds.lower is open, which is the direction a +slack term improves a minimize objective in. No data can change that, so the solve would answer `unbounded` and name nothing.
   Give it a finite bounds.lower, or the constraint that was meant to define it.
   ```

2. **Run it over every spec in CI.** The exit status is the gate, so a shell
   loop is the whole job:

   ```bash
   for spec in specs/*.yaml; do python -m mathspec check "$spec" || exit 1; done
   ```

3. **Ask from Python** where the check is one step of a longer script.
   [`to_spec`](../reference/api.md#loading) raises a `MathSpecError` for
   anything the language refuses, and [`advice`](../reference/api.md#advice)
   returns what it would print:

   ```python
   import mathspec as ms

   for note in ms.advice('spec.yaml'):
       print(note)
   ```

**Without Python**, the JSON schema checks the file's structure and nothing
inside an `expression:` or `where:` string
([editor completion and offline checking](installation.md#editor-completion-and-offline-checking)).

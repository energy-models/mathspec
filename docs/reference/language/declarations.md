# Parameters, variables, constraints and the objective

These four blocks carry the math, and `given:` names what the math reads from
another file. Each takes an optional `description:`, free text that the
[typeset](../typeset.md#descriptions) legend prints.

## `parameters`

A parameter declares a shape. The numbers arrive by name with the data.

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
parameters:
  load:
    dims: [snapshot]
  discount_rate:
    dims: [] # a scalar
```

| Field         |                                                                |                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `dims`        | required. The dimensions it is indexed by. `[]` means a scalar |                 |
| `dtype`       | `float`, `int`, `bool`, `str`                                  | default `float` |
| `description` | free text                                                      | default `null`  |

The column has to match the `dtype`:

| declared | the column                        |                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `float`  | a float column, or an integer one |                                               |
| `int`    | an integer column                 |                                               |
| `bool`   | a boolean column                  | `1` and `0` are not booleans. Cast the column |
| `str`    | a string column                   |                                               |

Only `float` and `int` are values. A `str` parameter is a label and a `bool`
parameter is a mask: each selects rows in a
[`where`](expressions.md#where-strings), and writing either as a coefficient,
a term or a divisor is a load error. A `0` or `1` that is meant to be
multiplied by is declared `dtype: int`.

## `variables`

A variable is what the solver decides. There is one column per coordinate of
`dims`.

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  generator: { dtype: str }
parameters:
  capacity: { dims: [generator] }
variables:
  dispatch:
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    where: "capacity > 0"
    bounds:
      lower: 0
      upper: capacity
```

| Field                           |                                                                                                                   |                      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `dims`                          | required. The dimensions it is indexed by                                                                         |                      |
| `where`                         | which coordinates exist ([absence](absence.md))                                                                   | default `null`       |
| `bounds.lower` / `bounds.upper` | a finite number, or the name of a `float` or `int` parameter. `null` leaves that side open                        | default `null`       |
| `domain`                        | `continuous`, `integer` or `binary`. `binary` carries fixed 0/1 bounds                                            | default `continuous` |
| `absence`                       | `undefined` or `zero`: what a masked-out coordinate means ([absence](absence.md#what-a-missing-coordinate-means)) | default `undefined`  |
| `description`                   | free text                                                                                                         | default `null`       |

An open side is `null`. A bound is never infinite: `.inf` and `-.inf` are
refused, with `null` named as the rewrite.

A bound is a name or a number: `upper: capacity` is accepted,
and `upper: -rating` is refused. Ship the negated column as data.

Equal bounds pin a variable ([fix a quantity](../../howto/pin-a-variable.md)).
A pinned variable is still a variable.

## `given`

`given:` holds what this file reads and does not build: data under
`parameters:`, columns under `variables:`, named expressions under
`expressions:`, and row families under `constraints:`. It takes those four keys
and no other. A file with a `given:` block loads and prints on its own.

### `given: parameters`

A given parameter is data this file reads and another file declares.

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  generator: { dtype: str }
given:
  parameters:
    gen_cost: { dims: [generator], description: what one unit of output costs }
    gen_on: { dims: [generator], dtype: bool }
  variables:
    gen_p: { dims: [snapshot, generator] }
constraints:
  off_units_idle:
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    where: not gen_on
    expression: gen_p <= 0
objective:
  sense: minimize
  expression: sum(gen_p * gen_cost)
```

| Field         |                                                      |                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `dims`        | required. The dimensions the parameter is indexed by |                 |
| `dtype`       | `float`, `int`, `bool` or `str`                      | default `float` |
| `description` | free text                                            | default `null`  |

A given parameter is read wherever a parameter is: in an expression, a `where`
and a bound. A name declared under both `parameters:` and
`given: parameters:` is refused. The typeset legend lists a given parameter
under _Given_.

### `given: variables`

A given variable is a column this file reads and another file introduces.

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  port: { dtype: str }
  generator: { dtype: str }
relations:
  gen_port: { key: generator, values: port }
variables:
  gen_p: { dims: [snapshot, generator], bounds: { lower: 0 } }
given:
  variables:
    flow:
      dims: [snapshot, port]
      description: what a port puts into its bus
constraints:
  gen_injects:
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    expression: at(flow, by=gen_port, over=port, into=generator) == gen_p
```

| Field         |                                                   |                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `dims`        | required. The dimensions the column is indexed by |                      |
| `domain`      | `continuous`, `integer` or `binary`               | default `continuous` |
| `description` | free text                                         | default `null`       |

There is no `bounds` and no `where`. The file that introduces the column owns
both.

An expression reads a given variable as it reads any other. A name declared
under both `variables:` and `given: variables:` is refused. The typeset legend
lists a given variable under _Given_, and prints no domain line for it.

[`merge`](../../howto/compose.md#a-library-of-components) folds a given
declaration into the declaration of another fragment that introduces the name,
so a composed library carries none of them. The folded declaration is the
introducer's, and what the reader states has to say the same or less.

Where nothing in this language introduces the column, the program carries the
declaration until a host model provides it
([what a program does not build](../reading.md#what-a-program-does-not-build)).

### `given: constraints`

A given constraint is a row family that another model builds. This file reads
its dual.

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  bus: { dtype: str }
given:
  constraints:
    balance:
      dims: [snapshot, bus]
      description: the host model clears each bus
expressions:
  price:
    expression: dual(balance)
```

| Field         |                                                   |                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `dims`        | required. The dimensions the row family runs over |                |
| `description` | free text                                         | default `null` |

There is no `expression` and no `sense`.
`dual(name)` is the only place a given row family may be named, and the frame
gives the reported expression its dimensions. A name declared under both
`constraints:` and `given: constraints:` is refused.

### `given: expressions`

A given expression is a named expression this file reads and another file
defines.

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  bus: { dtype: str }
given:
  expressions:
    injection:
      dims: [snapshot, bus]
      description: what the components put into a bus
constraints:
  balance:
    dims: [snapshot, bus]
    expression: injection == 0
```

| Field         |                                                                                 |                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `dims`        | required. The dimensions the expression runs over                               |                |
| `term`        | one expression: what this file adds to the name ([a term](#a-term-a-file-adds)) | default `null` |
| `description` | free text                                                                       | default `null` |

There is no body but the term this file adds, if any. This file reads the name
as it reads a given variable: a quantity over the frame, of degree one. A
`where` does not read it, because a mask is built before any variable exists.
A name declared under both `expressions:` and `given: expressions:` is
refused. The typeset legend lists a given expression under _Given_.

[`merge`](../../howto/compose.md#a-library-of-components) folds a given
expression into the definition of another fragment. The `dims` are an upper
bound: a body that carries a dimension they do not name is refused. A body over
fewer dimensions is folded, and the composed spec decides: it refuses a row
that would repeat across the missing dimension, and accepts one where another
term carries it. The composed spec holds the body to the rules of every place
this file reads it: a square of a given expression that is quadratic is
refused once folded.

#### A term a file adds

`term:` names the expression this file adds to the name. The term is an
ordinary named expression of this file, so it takes `cases:`, a description
and every other field a named expression takes. The file reads the name as
the whole sum, alone and composed, and the term is its part of it. A file that
only reads the name writes no term.

```yaml
# fleet.yaml adds a term
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  bus: { dtype: str }
  generator: { dtype: str }
relations:
  gen_bus: { key: generator, values: bus }
variables:
  gen_p: { dims: [snapshot, generator], bounds: { lower: 0 } }
expressions:
  generation:
    description: what the fleet puts into a bus
    expression: sum(gen_p, by=gen_bus, over=generator, into=bus)
given:
  expressions:
    injection:
      dims: [snapshot, bus]
      term: generation
```

```yaml
# balance.yaml reads the sum
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  bus: { dtype: str }
given:
  expressions:
    injection:
      dims: [snapshot, bus]
      description: what the components put into a bus
constraints:
  balance:
    dims: [snapshot, bus]
    expression: injection == 0
```

Each file loads alone. The term names an expression the file declares, and
that expression does not read the name it adds to, directly or through
another name. It carries no dimension the entry does not state, and it is
held to degree two, as what reads the sum is. All of this is checked at load.
The typeset legend lists the entry under _Given_ and names the term, and the
math prints the term under _Definitions_ as its own line.

[`merge`](../../howto/compose.md#a-library-of-components) defines the name as
the definition one fragment writes under `expressions:`, if any, plus every
term by its name, in fragment-name order, and keeps each term as a named
expression of the composed spec. Nothing declares that the name is a sum: a
term adds to whatever the other files define, as a fragment's objective adds
to the objective, and a later merge adds to the composed definition the same
way. The file that defines the name does not opt in. It reads the name as its
own definition alone, and as the definition plus every term once composed;
whoever composes the files answers for that sum. A term has to land on a name another file
has: one that defines it, reads it with no term of its own, or uses it in its
math. Terms alone are refused, with the near miss named, since `merge` fills
a reading or extends a definition and never invents a name. A definition
written as `cases:` is refused, since it is summed as written: name the cased
body as its own expression, and define the name as that name. A cased term is
added like any other, by its name. The definition keeps its own description,
or takes the first a reader wrote. Two files that both define the name under
`expressions:` are refused as a collision, and the message names `term:`.

## `constraints`

One block is one rule. The name of the block is the name of the constraint.

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  generator: { dtype: str }
parameters:
  load: { dims: [snapshot] }
variables:
  dispatch: { dims: [snapshot, generator] }
constraints:
  power_balance:
    dims: [snapshot]
    expression: sum(dispatch, over=generator) == load
```

| Field         |                                                     |                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `dims`        | required. The rows this rule builds                 |                |
| `expression`  | required. It uses exactly one of `<=`, `>=` or `==` |                |
| `where`       | which rows are built ([absence](absence.md))        | default `null` |
| `description` | free text                                           | default `null` |

The dimensions of the expression must **equal** its `dims`
([how dimensions combine](expressions.md#how-dimensions-combine)).

At least one side of the comparator carries a variable. A comparison between
numbers and parameters alone is refused at load.

`dims: []` gives one scalar row. A scalar variable may not carry a `where`; put the condition on the constraints
that use it.

Two regimes of one rule are two blocks, each under its own `where:`
([state a rule that differs by regime](../../howto/regimes.md)).

## `objective`

The objective is a single block with no name.

```yaml
dimensions:
  generator: { dtype: str }
parameters:
  cost: { dims: [generator] }
variables:
  dispatch: { dims: [generator] }
objective:
  sense: minimize
  expression: sum(dispatch * cost)
```

| Field         |                                          |                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `expression`  | required. Arithmetic, with no comparator |                    |
| `sense`       | `minimize` or `maximize`                 | default `minimize` |
| `description` | free text                                | default `null`     |

The expression must be **scalar**. Nothing is summed for you:
`sum(x * a) + sum(y * b)` and `sum(x * a + y * b)` are both allowed, and they
state different objectives.

There is one objective block. To pursue several goals, weight them into one
expression.

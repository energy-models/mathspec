# Piecewise curves and SOS

`piecewise:` states a curve through breakpoints. `sos:` states a family of
variables of which only one, or only two neighbours, may be non-zero. Both are
**formulations**: each states plain variables and constraints, and
[`spec.expand()`](#writing-a-formulation-out) writes them out.

## `piecewise`

A `piecewise` block ties two or more expressions to one piecewise-linear curve.
The curve is given as breakpoints: the corner values each expression takes
together.

```yaml
piecewise:
  chp:
    over: bp # breakpoint dimension
    links:
      - [power, power_bp] # [expression, values-parameter]
      - [fuel, fuel_bp]
      - [heat, heat_bp]
    method: adjacency # how the weights are restricted — below
    activity: null # optional: a binary variable that the weights sum to

  # a two-link block may bound one side instead of pinning it
  fuel_cap:
    over: bp
    links:
      - [power, power_bp]
      - [fuel, fuel_bp, "<="]
```

| Part of a link |                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _expression_   | Any affine expression. The simplest is a bare variable name                                                                                  |
| _values_       | A parameter that carries the `over` dimension, plus any dimensions the link expressions carry. A dimension the links do not carry is refused |
| _sign_         | `<=` or `>=`. At most one per block, and only in a block with exactly two links. It bounds the link instead of pinning it                    |

| Key        |                                                                                          |                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `over`     | required. The breakpoint dimension                                                       |                     |
| `links`    | required. Two or more links                                                              |                     |
| `method`   | `adjacency`, `sos2`, `convex` or `lp`: how the weights are restricted ([below](#method)) | default `adjacency` |
| `activity` | a binary variable that gates the curve ([below](#activity))                              | default `null`      |
| `points`   | how far each curve runs, where the curves are not all the same length ([below](#points)) | default `null`      |

A block states one weight per breakpoint in `[0, 1]`, a row making the weights
sum to 1, and a row per link tying its expression to the weighted breakpoints.
The breakpoint order is the declared order of `over`. What a block assumes of
its numbers is on [what a curve assumes](assumptions.md#what-a-curve-assumes).

### `activity`

`activity:` names a binary variable, and the weights then sum to that variable
instead of to 1. So `0` pins the curve off.

The gate is a declaration:

```yaml
variables:
  running:
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    domain: binary
    where: committable # only some units have a commitment decision
```

Where the gate does not exist, the curve is ungated. To have no curve there
instead, put `absence: zero` on the gate.

### `points`

A values parameter short of a row does not build a shorter curve: the missing
row reads as a breakpoint at the origin. A curve with fewer breakpoints than the
dimension holds says so with `points:`. Name one of the block's own values
parameters, and the curve is as long as that parameter has rows:

```yaml
piecewise:
  cost_curve:
    over: bp
    points: bp_x # this curve runs as far as its own breakpoints do
    links:
      - [p, bp_x]
      - [op_cost, bp_y]
```

A row missing from `bp_y` is still refused. Where the length is its own data,
name a boolean parameter instead. The marked breakpoints are one consecutive
run, anywhere on the axis.

### `method`

`method` says how the weights are restricted once they exist.

| `method`                | What it adds                                                                  |                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `adjacency` _(default)_ | an [`sos:`](#sos) block over the weights, written out as binaries             | the curve, built                                               |
| `sos2`                  | an [`sos:`](#sos) block over the weights, left as a set                       | the curve, stated for a solver that branches on the set itself |
| `convex`                | nothing                                                                       | the hull, which is a pure linear program                       |
| `lp`                    | no weights at all: one row per segment line, plus two rows holding the domain | the curve as its own lines                                     |

`convex` takes exactly two links and no `activity:`. The shape it needs is an
[assumption](assumptions.md#what-a-curve-assumes).

`lp` states the curve as its segment lines. It needs **exactly two links**, one
of them bounded with `<=` or `>=`, and no `activity:`:

```yaml
piecewise:
  cost_curve:
    over: bp
    method: lp
    links:
      - [p, bp_x]
      - [op_cost, bp_y, ">="] # cost bounded below by the curve
```

Where the number of links is data, write the formulation out ([a curve by hand](../../howto/curve-by-hand.md)).

## `sos`

An `sos` block declares a **special-ordered set**: one dimension of one
variable, and how many members of that family may be non-zero at once.

```yaml
sos:
  pick_one_size:
    variable: build # the variable the set is over
    along: size # the dimension it runs along — one set per coordinate of the rest
    type: 1 # 1: at most one non-zero; 2: at most two, and consecutive
```

A set is over **one** variable, and a variable holds **one** set. A second block
naming the same variable is a load error.

A member the variable's `where` masks out is not in the set. The order is the
declared order of the `along` dimension.

### What a set is written out as

`spec.expand('sos')` states the set as binaries: one per member for `type: 1`,
one per segment for `type: 2`. A member the binaries do not admit is held at
zero, from above and from below. For a set `s` over variable `x` along `d`,
writing `admitted` for
`(s_seg)` at `type: 1` and `(s_seg + shift(s_seg, along=d, offset=1, edge=0))`
at `type: 2`:

| Emitted                                            |                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `s_seg`                                            | a binary over `x`'s own dims, masked as `x` is    |
| `s_pick`: `sum(s_seg, over=d) <= 1`                | at most one is picked                             |
| `s_nonzero` (`type: 1`), `s_adjacency` (`type: 2`) | `x <= upper * admitted`                           |
| the same name plus `_below`                        | `x >= lower * admitted`, where `lower` is not `0` |

`upper` and `lower` are the member's own `bounds:`, a number or a parameter;
a binary member's are `0` and `1`. A spec is refused at load where a member
has no `bounds.lower`, or no `bounds.upper` and no `domain: binary`. A name the
expansion writes that the file already declares is refused at load too.

## Writing a formulation out

Writing a formulation out replaces the block with the variables and constraints
it states. [`Spec.expand()`](../api.md#mathspec.Spec.expand) is the
call, and [see what a curve or a set expands to](../../howto/see-an-expansion.md)
shows a spec before and after.

- **Every name written out starts with the name of the block.** The weights of
  the curve `curve` are `curve_lam`.
- **No formulation emits a parameter.** The same data attaches to a spec and its
  expansion.
- **The assumptions a `method:` implies become `assumptions:` entries** with
  the same names.

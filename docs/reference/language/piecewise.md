# Piecewise curves and SOS

`piecewise:` states a curve through breakpoints. `sos:` states a family of
variables of which only one, or only two neighbours, may be non-zero. Both are
**formulations**: each states plain variables and constraints, and
[`spec.expand()`](#writing-a-formulation-out) writes them out.

## `piecewise`

A `piecewise` block ties expressions to one piecewise-linear curve for every
coordinate of its `dims:`. The curve is given as breakpoints: the corner values
each expression takes together.

```yaml
piecewise:
  chp:
    along: bp # the dimension each curve runs along
    dims: [generator, snapshot] # one curve per coordinate of these
    links: # each link by the name of the row it writes, chp_<link>
      power: [power, power_bp] # [expression, values-parameter]
      fuel: [fuel, fuel_bp]
      heat: [heat, heat_bp]
    method: adjacency # how the weights are restricted — below
    activity: null # optional: a binary variable that the weights sum to

  # a link may be bounded by the curve instead of pinned to it
  fuel_cap:
    along: bp
    dims: [generator, snapshot]
    links:
      power: [power, power_bp]
      fuel: [fuel, fuel_bp, "<="]
```

| Part of a link       |                                                                                                                                                                       |

A block states one weight per breakpoint in `[0, 1]`, a row making the weights
sum to 1, and a row per link tying its expression to the weighted breakpoints.
The breakpoint order is the declared order of `along`. What a block assumes of
its numbers is on [what a curve assumes](assumptions.md#what-a-curve-assumes).

A link names the row it writes, so a link may not take a name the block
already writes for itself, such as `convexity` or `lam`. No two blocks may write
the same name: in a file with blocks `a` and `a_b`, a link `b_x` of `a` is
refused, because its row `a_b_x` is also the row of the link `x` of `a_b`.

### `dims`

A block builds one curve for every coordinate of `dims:`. Each curve is one set
of weights. `dims:` may not carry the breakpoint dimension, because every curve
runs along it.

**A link expression carries exactly the dimensions of its row.** The row of a
link is `dims:`, or the dimensions a [walk](#a-link-that-walks-a-relation)
reaches. A dimension the expression carries and the row does not multiplies the
rows the link builds. A dimension the row carries and the expression does not
repeats one row across it, which pins the expression to a single operating point
along a dimension the curve varies over. Both are refused, and the message
names which one it is.

A quantity that varies along a dimension the curve does not, such as a rate per
period read off a curve that has none, is said by adding that dimension to
`dims:`. The curve then varies along it too. Whether the breakpoint values also
vary along it is the data's business: values that do not carry it give one curve
shape and a per-period operating point.

An [`activity:`](#activity) gate carries no dimension that `dims:` does not. A
gate over fewer dimensions switches every curve it covers: a gate per generator
switches that generator's curve in every snapshot.

### `where`

`where:` says which coordinates of `dims:` have a curve:

```yaml
piecewise:
  cost_curve:
    along: bp
    dims: [generator]
    where: has_curve # only some generators run on a cost curve
    links:
      dispatch: [dispatch, bp_x]
      op_cost: [op_cost, bp_y]
```

Off the mask the block builds nothing. There are no weights, no convexity row
and no link row, so the linked expressions are left free. The breakpoint values
are not read there either: a generator with no curve needs no row in `bp_x` or
`bp_y`.

`where:` is not [`activity:`](#activity). A coordinate outside the mask has no
curve. A gated coordinate has a curve that the solver may switch off, and its
rows are built either way.

A mask carrying a dimension that `dims:` does not carry is refused, because a
mask cannot add coordinates. The breakpoint dimension is the one exception, and
reading it is how a block says how far each curve runs.

#### Curves of unequal length

A values parameter short of a row does not build a shorter curve: the missing
row reads as a breakpoint at the origin. A curve with fewer breakpoints than the
dimension holds says so with a `where:` that reads the breakpoint dimension. Name one of the block's own values
parameters, and the curve is as long as that parameter has rows:

```yaml
piecewise:
  cost_curve:
    along: bp
    dims: [generator]
    where: bp_x # this curve runs as far as its own breakpoints do
    links:
      p: [p, bp_x]
      op_cost: [op_cost, bp_y]
```

The other links are still read against the parameter you named, so a row missing
from `bp_y` is refused. Where the length is its own data, name a boolean
parameter over `dims:` and the breakpoint dimension instead. Either composes
with a mask over `dims:`: `has_curve AND bp_x` says which generators have a
curve and how far each one runs.

The marked breakpoints must be consecutive. They need not start at the head of
the axis. A gap is refused when the data is attached, and a coordinate the mask
leaves with no breakpoint has no curve.

The rows a block writes over `dims:` alone, such as the one making the weights
sum to 1, cannot read the breakpoint dimension. There the mask reads as
`count(where, over=bp) > 0`: a curve exists where it admits at least one
breakpoint.

### `activity`

`activity:` names a binary variable, and the weights then sum to that variable
instead of to 1. So `0` pins the curve off.

The gate is a declaration:

```yaml
variables:
  running:
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    domain: binary
    where: committable # only some units have a commitment decision
```

Where the gate does not exist, the curve is ungated. To pin the curve off
there instead, put `absence: zero` on the gate. To build no curve there at all,
use [`where:`](#where).

### A link that walks a relation

A link that names `by:`, `over:` and `into:` reads the curve's weights through a
[relation](relations.md#how-a-relation-is-used), as [`at`](operators.md#at)
does. It builds one row per coordinate that the walk reaches, and every row
reads the curve of the coordinate it maps back to. So the number of **rows** a
link builds is data. A converter with two flows and a converter with five share
one block:

```yaml
relations:
  generator_of: { key: flow, values: generator }

piecewise:
  coupling:
    along: bp
    dims: [generator, snapshot] # one curve per generator
    links:
      power: { expression: power, values: bp_power, by: generator_of, over: generator, into: flow }
      fuel: [fuel, bp_fuel]
```

`power` is per flow and the curve is per generator, so the `power` link builds
one row for each flow of a generator. A sixth flow is a row in `generator_of`,
not an edit to the spec.

The row of a walked link is `dims:` with the dimension that `over:` consumes
replaced by the one that `into:` produces: `[flow, snapshot]` above. The block
writes `at(coupling_lam, by=generator_of, over=generator, into=flow)` into that
row, so the weights stay on `dims:` and the spec never names them.

`by:`, `over:` and `into:` are written together. A walk states the relation, the
columns it consumes and the columns it produces, and none is defaulted. Each of
`over:` and `into:` names at least one column. A link whose row is finer than
`dims:` is always a walk: a link that names only `into:` is refused.

A walk is held to every rule of `at`, as the spec loads, and a refusal names
the link. `into:` names key columns of the relation, and the read has one value
at each coordinate it lands on. A key column that the walk does not name is
joined on, so its dimension is one of `dims:`.

A block whose only link walks a relation is a curve. Two links is what a curve
needs when a link is one row; a walked link is one row per fine coordinate, so
the relation supplies the second.

**A walked row reads the block's `where:` through its relation.** The mask is
over `dims:` and the row is over the dimensions the walk produces, so the row
takes `at(<where>, by=…, over=…, into=…)`, a
[predicate read through a relation](expressions.md#reading-a-predicate-through-a-relation).
Only some generators have a curve:

```yaml
piecewise:
  coupling:
    along: bp
    dims: [generator, snapshot]
    where: has_curve # over generator: a generator with no curve has no weights and no rows
    links:
      power: { expression: power, values: bp_power, by: generator_of, over: generator, into: flow }
```

The `power` row is built where
`at(has_curve, by=generator_of, over=generator, into=flow)` holds, which is at
every flow of a generator with a curve. The values of a walked link are asked
for at the same rows, so a flow of a generator with no curve needs no row in
`bp_power`. A mask that carries no dimension the walk consumes, such as
`snapshot` alone, reaches the row as written. This is also true when the
relation is keyed on `snapshot` too, because the row keeps every dimension the
walk joins on. A mask that carries a dimension the walk consumes and not every
dimension the walk joins on is refused, and the message names the ones missing.
A mask over a dimension a walk produces, such as `flow`, is refused: the mask
says which curves exist, and there is one curve per coordinate of `dims:`.

| A walked link |                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _over_        | names a column over a dimension of `dims:`                                                                                                                 |
| _into_        | names key columns over dimensions that `dims:` does not carry, and that are not `along`                                                                    |
| _by_          | a relation whose other key columns are over dimensions of `dims:`                                                                                          |
| _values_      | follows the **link's** row: `bp_power` is per flow, not per generator                                                                                      |
| `where:`      | on the block reaches the link's row read through the relation, or as written where the mask carries none of the dimensions the walk consumes               |
| `method:`     | `adjacency` or `sos2`. `lp` loses the abscissa its segment line is written against, and `convex` loses the pair of values parameters it reads a shape from |

### Signs

A link with no sign is **pinned** to the curve: its expression equals the
weighted breakpoints. A link carrying `<=` or `>=` is **bounded** by the curve
instead, and each link carries its own.

**At least one link is pinned.** A pinned link fixes the operating point every
other link is read at. With every link bounded the weights are free, and the
block no longer says that its quantities sit together on a curve. It says only
that some point on the curve satisfies the bounds. That is a different model,
so it is refused.

```yaml
piecewise:
  chp:
    along: bp
    dims: [generator, snapshot]
    links:
      power: [power, power_bp] # pinned: it fixes the operating point
      fuel: [fuel, fuel_bp, ">="] # bounded below by the curve
      heat: [heat, heat_bp, "<="] # bounded above, at that same point
```

The typeset line prints this block as the point `(power, fuel, heat)` on the
curve plus `{0} × ℝ≥0 × ℝ≤0`: the pinned coordinate moves by nothing, and each
bounded one by the half-line its sign allows. A block with exactly two links
prints its bounded link as a function of the pinned one instead.

`convex` and `lp` take exactly two links, so there a sign is one link's at
most. Under `adjacency` and `sos2` each link is its own row against the shared
weights, so the count is whatever the spec needs.

### `method`

`method` says how the weights are restricted once they exist.

| `method`                | What it adds                                                                  |                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `adjacency` _(default)_ | an [`sos:`](#sos) block over the weights, written out as binaries             | the curve, built                                               |
| `sos2`                  | an [`sos:`](#sos) block over the weights, left as a set                       | the curve, stated for a solver that branches on the set itself |
| `convex`                | nothing                                                                       | the hull, which is a pure linear program                       |
| `lp`                    | no weights at all: one row per segment line, plus two rows holding the domain | the curve as its own lines                                     |

`convex` takes exactly two links and no `activity:`. The shape it needs is an
[assumption](assumptions.md#what-a-curve-assumes).

`lp` states the curve as its segment lines. It takes **exactly two links**,
because a line is one quantity against another: one link names the abscissa and
one is bounded by the lines. It takes no `activity:`:

```yaml
piecewise:
  cost_curve:
    along: bp
    dims: [generator]
    method: lp
    links:
      p: [p, bp_x]
      op_cost: [op_cost, bp_y, ">="] # cost bounded below by the curve
```

## `sos`

An `sos` block declares a **special-ordered set**: one dimension of one
variable, and how many members of that family may be non-zero at once.

```yaml
sos:
  pick_one_size:
    variable: build # the variable the set is over
    along: size # the dimension it runs along — one set per coordinate of the rest
    type: 1 # 1: at most one non-zero; 2: at most two, and consecutive
```

A set is over **one** variable, and a variable holds **one** set. A second block
naming the same variable is a load error.

A member the variable's `where` masks out is not in the set. The order is the
declared order of the `along` dimension.

### What a set is written out as

`spec.expand('sos')` states the set as binaries: one per member for `type: 1`,
one per segment for `type: 2`. A member the binaries do not admit is held at
zero, from above and from below. For a set `s` over variable `x` along `d`,
writing `admitted` for
`(s_seg)` at `type: 1` and `(s_seg + shift(s_seg, along=d, offset=1, edge=0))`
at `type: 2`:

| Emitted                                            |                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `s_seg`                                            | a binary over `x`'s own dims, masked as `x` is    |
| `s_pick`: `sum(s_seg, over=d) <= 1`                | at most one is picked                             |
| `s_nonzero` (`type: 1`), `s_adjacency` (`type: 2`) | `x <= upper * admitted`                           |
| the same name plus `_below`                        | `x >= lower * admitted`, where `lower` is not `0` |

`upper` and `lower` are the member's own `bounds:`, a number or a parameter;
a binary member's are `0` and `1`. A spec is refused at load where a member
has no `bounds.lower`, or no `bounds.upper` and no `domain: binary`. A name the
expansion writes that the file already declares is refused at load too.

## Writing a formulation out

Writing a formulation out replaces the block with the variables and constraints
it states. [`Spec.expand()`](../api.md#mathspec.Spec.expand) is the
call, and [see what a curve or a set expands to](../../howto/see-an-expansion.md)
shows a spec before and after.

- **Every name written out starts with the name of the block.** The weights of
  the curve `curve` are `curve_lam`.
- **No formulation emits a parameter.** The same data attaches to a spec and its
  expansion.
- **The assumptions a `method:` implies become `assumptions:` entries** with
  the same names.

# Named expressions and macros

An `expressions:` entry names a quantity once, for the math to read or for a
solve to report. A `macros:` entry is a template with arguments, substituted
before anything reads it.

## `expressions`

A constraint or the objective may use a named expression, and a solve may
report its value:

```yaml
dimensions:
  generator: { dtype: str }
parameters:
  rate: { dims: [generator] }
variables:
  p: { dims: [generator] }
expressions:
  total_generation: sum(p, over=generator)
  emissions:
    expression: sum(p * rate, over=generator)
    description: CO2 released, the quantity a cap would bound
```

It is a bare string, or a mapping with a `description:` and a `dims:`. The
`dims:` are the **frame**, the dimensions the quantity is read over. Left out,
the body decides the frame. Declared, the body may carry no dimension the
frame does not name, which the loader checks, and it may carry fewer: the
quantity is then constant along the rest, and a constraint over the whole frame
reads it at every coordinate.

```yaml
expressions:
  cap:
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    expression: p_max
    description: the nominal capacity, the same in every snapshot
```

Where the objective or a constraint names it, the body is substituted there,
and the [degree limit](expressions.md#where-a-product-of-two-variables-is-allowed)
applies where it is read. Where nothing in the math names it, the entry is
[reported](#reported-expressions).

## `cases`

A quantity with several regimes is written as cases, and the rule that reads it
is written once. The commitment state a unit carries into a snapshot is `1`
for a unit that is never switched off, an initial condition at the first
snapshot, and the previous snapshot's status everywhere else:

```yaml
expressions:
  previous_status:
    description: the commitment state a unit carries into a snapshot
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    cases:
      always_on:
        when: "not committable"
        expression: 1
      boundary:
        when: "committable and position(snapshot) == 0"
        expression: status_initial
    otherwise: shift(status, along=snapshot, offset=1)
constraints:
  ramp_up:
    dims: [snapshot, generator]
    expression: >-
      p - shift(p, along=snapshot, offset=1, edge=0)
      <= ramp_limit * previous_status + start_up_limit * (1 - previous_status)
```

Each case prints as one row of the definition, and `otherwise:` as the last:

$$\mathit{previous\_status}_{t,g} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \neg \mathrm{committable}_{g} \cr \mathrm{status}^{\mathrm{initial}}_{g} & \text{if } \mathrm{committable}_{g} \wedge \mathrm{pos}(t) = 0 \cr \mathit{status}_{t - 1,g} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

A named expression carries **exactly one** of `expression:` and `cases:`.

| Key         |                                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dims`      | required with `cases:`. The **frame**: the dimensions every case ranges over |
| `cases`     | a map of named cases, each with a `when:` mask and an `expression:`          |
| `otherwise` | required. The value at every coordinate the cases leave                      |

### The rules that keep the cases apart

- **No two cases may claim one coordinate.** If two `when:` masks can hold at
  once, the file is refused at load:

  > `Named expression 'previous_status'`: cases `always_on` and `boundary` both
  > claim the value where committable is false, the position of snapshot is 0. A
  > coordinate two cases claim has two values, so it has none — narrow one of the
  > two `when:` strings by the negation of the other, or drop the wider one and
  > let `otherwise:` carry that region.

  The cases carry no order.

- **A `when:` must be a question the data answers.** `True`, `False`, and a mask
  that folds to one of them, such as `committable OR True`, are refused.

- **A pair the check cannot decide is refused.** `position(snapshot) == 0`
  against `position(snapshot) == -1` pick the same row on an axis with one
  member. Count from one end only.

- **A `when:` may not compare expressions**, such as `c > 2 * k`, even in a
  block with one case. Precompute the test as a boolean parameter.

- **Each `when:` and each value sits inside the frame.** A narrower case
  broadcasts as a parameter with fewer dimensions does.

A claimed coordinate can still have no value: the `otherwise:` above has none
at the first snapshot, where a case claims every unit. To close such a hole,
widen a `when`, give the `shift` an `edge=`, or set `absence: zero` on the
masked variable.

`cases:` is not accepted inside a `macros:` template.

## Reported expressions

A named expression is either **in the math** or **reported**. The objective
and the constraints decide which:

```yaml
dimensions:
  generator: { dtype: str }
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
parameters:
  marginal_cost: { dims: [generator] }
variables:
  p: { dims: [snapshot, generator] }
expressions:
  system_cost: sum(sum(p * marginal_cost, over=generator), over=snapshot)
  delivered: sum(sum(p, over=generator), over=snapshot)
  lcoe: system_cost / delivered
objective: { sense: minimize, expression: system_cost }
```

`system_cost` is in the math. `delivered` and `lcoe` are reported.

An entry is in the math when the objective, a constraint or a `piecewise:`
link reaches it, directly or through another entry or a macro. A bound and a
`where` name no entry.

**No degree limit applies to a reported entry**: it may divide by a variable,
raise one to a power, and multiply two sums. A comparison stays out. A
constraint that names such an entry is refused under the constraint's own name.

### Reading a constraint's dual

`dual(c)` reads the **row dual** of the constraint `c`: the shadow price a solve
puts on that row, over `c`'s own `dims`. Only a reported entry may call it. In a
constraint, the objective, a piecewise link, or an entry one of those inlines,
it is refused:

```text
Constraint 'd': a dual exists only after a solve; the math cannot read one —
keep the entry that carries it out of constraints, the objective, bounds and where.
```

`dual(c)` is the rate at which the optimal objective improves as `c` is relaxed
in the direction its comparator points, under the spec's own `minimize` or
`maximize`.

A row that `c`'s `where:` deletes has no dual.

## `macros`

A macro is a template that takes arguments and is substituted into an expression
before anything reads it:

```yaml
macros:
  weighted_sum:
    args: [array, weights] # positional formals, default []
    kwargs: [over] # keyword formals, default []
    template: sum(array * weights, over=over)
```

- A template holds arithmetic, and no comparison.
- An argument may itself use macros and named expressions.
- Inside a template, the formal parameters shadow the names the spec
  declares. A formal may not collide with a declared dimension.
- The number of arguments is checked at each call site. A cycle is reported with
  its reference chain.
- Every template is held at load to every rule a call site is, whether or not it
  is called. A formal is left for the call site to bind.

A composition of the [built-in operators](operators.md) belongs here. What
the language will not express is in
[the limits](../../about/limits.md#deliberate-non-primitives).

# Expressions

Every `expression:` in the file is written in one arithmetic grammar. That
covers a constraint, the objective, a named expression and a macro template:

```text
expression  ::= arithmetic | arithmetic COMPARATOR arithmetic
arithmetic  ::= atom | unary_op arithmetic | arithmetic binary_op arithmetic
             |  function_call | "(" arithmetic ")"
atom        ::= NUMBER | NAME
unary_op    ::= "+" | "-"       binary_op ::= "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "**"
COMPARATOR  ::= "<=" | ">=" | "=="
function_call ::= NAME "(" [pos_arg ("," pos_arg)*] ["," kwarg ("," kwarg)*] ")"
kwarg       ::= NAME "=" (arithmetic | QUOTED | "[" NAME ("," NAME)* "]")
NAME        ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
NUMBER      ::= integer | float | "inf" | ".inf"
```

- Operators bind in this order, highest first: `**`, then unary `+` and `-`,
  then `*` and `/`, then binary `+` and `-`. So `-x ** 2` is `-(x ** 2)`, as in
  Python.
- A float may carry an exponent, as in `1e5` or `2.5e-3`.
- The same keyword twice in one call is an error.
- An expression and a `where:` string nest at most 100 levels deep, and at most
  300 with every named expression they read written in.

## Where a product of two variables is allowed

The objective and the constraints take `variable * variable`. A quadratic cost is
`sum(p * p * wear, over=g)`, and a quadratic row is `p * q >= floor`. Three rules
bound it:

- **At most one factor may be a sum of terms.** `sum(p, over=g) * sum(q, over=g)`
  is refused. Multiply before you reduce, or constrain a variable to equal the
  reduction. Factors on different dimensions are allowed: `x * y * link`
  broadcasts, and the table `link` says which pairs exist.
- **Degree stops at 2.** `p * p * p` is refused.
- **Everything beside the math stays affine.** A bound is one number per
  column, and a `piecewise:` link is affine.

A [reported expression](named.md#reported-expressions) is not held to these.

`/` needs a divisor that carries no variable. `**` needs a base and an exponent
that carry no variable. Any arithmetic over numbers and parameters is allowed in
those places, so a discount factor is written where it is used:

```yaml
dimensions:
  period: { dtype: int }
parameters:
  rate: { dims: [] }
  years: { dims: [period] }
  price: { dims: [period] }
variables:
  build: { dims: [period], bounds: { lower: 0 } }
constraints:
  enough: { dims: [], expression: "sum(build, over=period) >= 1" }
objective:
  sense: minimize
  expression: sum(build * price / (1 + rate) ** years, over=period)
```

`years` is a parameter over `period`. The exponent cannot be `period` itself,
because an expression reads no [dimension](#name-resolution). Write `x * x` for
a square.

## Name resolution

One flat namespace covers dimensions, relations, parameters, variables, named
expressions, masks, macros and the built-in operators. A collision is a load error that
names both declarations, and nothing shadows anything.

Position decides which kinds of name are legal:

| Position                               | Legal kinds                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| expression (`p * cost`)                | a variable, or a parameter whose values are numbers ([dtype](declarations.md#parameters))                          |
| dimension argument (`over=`, `along=`) | a dimension                                                                                                        |
| relation argument (`by=`)              | a relation. `over=`, `into=` and `within=` name its columns                                                        |
| `where` string                         | a parameter, variable, dimension, relation or mask ([where strings](#where-strings))                               |
| `bounds.lower` / `bounds.upper`        | a parameter name, or a number                                                                                      |
| the `edge` key of `shift`              | `'wrap'` in quotes, or a bare number                                                                               |
| `dual` argument (`dual(c)`)            | a constraint. It resolves against the constraints alone ([named expressions](named.md#reading-a-constraints-dual)) |

A bare word in the value of a keyword argument is a name to resolve. A
keyword's key is never a name.

Constraints and assumptions sit outside the flat namespace, so a constraint or
an assumption may share a variable's name.

## How dimensions combine

The dimension set of every expression is known before any data is attached:

| Node                             | Dim set                           | Error                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| number                           | `{}`                              |                                                                                  |
| parameter / variable             | its `dims`                        |                                                                                  |
| `-x`, `+x`                       | `dims(x)`                         |                                                                                  |
| `a + b`, `a * b`, `a / b`        | `dims(a) ∪ dims(b)`               |                                                                                  |
| `sum(x)`                         | `{}`                              | error if `dims(x)` is already empty                                              |
| `sum(x, over=d)`                 | `dims(x) − {d}`                   | error if `d ∉ dims(x)`                                                           |
| `sum(x, by=l, over=a, into=b)`   | `(dims(x) − consumed) ∪ produced` | the refusals under [how a relation is used](relations.md#how-a-relation-is-used) |
| `at(x, by=l, over=a, into=b)`    | `(dims(x) − consumed) ∪ produced` | the same                                                                         |
| `shift(x, along=d, offset=n)`    | `dims(x)`                         | error if `d ∉ dims(x)`                                                           |
| `sum_back(x, along=d, window=n)` | `dims(x)`                         | error if `d ∉ dims(x)`                                                           |

An outer product is allowed. The declaration's own dimensions are its
**frame**, and a declaration may not disagree with its expression:

- A constraint requires `dims(lhs) ∪ dims(rhs)` to **equal** its `dims`.
- An objective must carry **no dimensions**. Write the sums that reduce it.
- A `where` predicate and a bound parameter must not **exceed** the frame they
  sit in.

Each of these is a load error.

## `where` strings

A `where:` is a boolean mask, and true means "this coordinate exists".

A bare name that is not declared is a load error.

### Counting what a predicate admits

`count(<where_expr>, over=<dimension>)` is how many coordinates along that
dimension the predicate is true at:

```yaml
dimensions:
  bp: { dtype: int }
  generator: { dtype: str }
parameters:
  bp_x: { dims: [generator, bp] }
  points: { dims: [generator, bp], dtype: bool }
variables:
  p:
    dims: [generator]
    where: "count(points, over=bp) >= 2"
    bounds: { lower: 0 }
constraints:
  cap:
    dims: [generator]
    expression: p <= 1
objective:
  sense: minimize
  expression: sum(p, over=generator)
```

$$\lvert \{ b \in \mathcal{B} \thinspace : \thinspace \mathrm{points}_{g,b} \} \rvert \ge 2 \qquad \forall\thinspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

The dimension counted over is **removed**, as a `sum(over=)` removes it: one
count per generator above. Counting along a dimension the predicate does not
read is a load error.

The right-hand side is a whole number. A fraction, a parameter, and a
comparison a count can never fail or never meet (`>= 0`, `< 0`, or any
negative number) are load errors.

### Reading a predicate at the previous coordinate

`shift(<where_expr>, along=<dimension>, offset=<integer>)` reads the predicate
`offset` coordinates back. It is **false** where the translation vacates, and
it takes no `edge=`. With `count`, it names the start of a run:

```yaml
where: "count(points AND NOT shift(points, along=bp, offset=1), over=bp) == 1"
```

That reads: the marked breakpoints are one consecutive run.

A negative `offset` reads forwards. `by=`, `within=` and `edge='wrap'` are not
in this form; for a grouped or cyclic translation, compare the arithmetic
`shift`.

### Reading a predicate through a relation

`at(<where_expr>, by=<relation>, over=<a>, into=<b>)` reads a predicate over
coarse coordinates at fine ones, as [`at`](operators.md#at) reads an array. It
is true where the relation has a row and the predicate holds at the coordinate
that row maps to, and **false** where the relation has no row.

```yaml
dimensions:
  converter: { dtype: str }
  flow: { dtype: str }
relations:
  converter_of: { key: flow, values: converter }
parameters:
  has_curve: { dims: [converter], dtype: bool }
  cap: { dims: [flow] }
variables:
  rate:
    dims: [flow]
    where: "at(has_curve, by=converter_of, over=converter, into=flow)"
    bounds: { lower: 0, upper: cap }
objective:
  sense: minimize
  expression: sum(rate, over=flow)
```

$$0 \le \mathit{rate}_{f} \le \mathrm{cap}_{f} \qquad \forall\thinspace f \in \mathcal{F} \thinspace : \thinspace \mathrm{has\_curve}_{\mathrm{converter\_of}(f)}$$

The mask above is over `flow` alone. The rules are those of `at` in an
expression: `by=`, `over=` and `into=` are all written, each of `over=` and
`into=` names one column or a list of them, `[a, …]`, the read lands on the
relation's key, and the predicate carries every dimension the read consumes.

### The right-hand side of a comparison

A bare name on the right is read as a string label when the spec does not
declare it. A declared name there is a load error.

Quote a label that is not an identifier, such as `'combined-cycle'`. A quoted
word is never read as a declaration.

A comparison is checked against the declared `dtype`. A `datetime` dimension is
compared against a quoted ISO date such as `'2030-01-01'` or
`'2030-01-01T06:00'`, and a number against it is a load error.

String labels compare bytewise, whatever the dimension's order. A label the
dimension does not carry compares equal to nothing.

Comparing two dimensions is not in the language. Precompute a boolean parameter
instead.

### Arithmetic in a comparison

Either side of a comparison may be an expression over parameters:
`p_min <= 0.5 * p_max`, or
`p_max <= at(bus_cap, by=bus_of, over=bus, into=generator)`. The side is read as
an [expression](#expressions) is, macros and named expressions included. A
variable and a `dual()` are refused. A relation column and a quoted label are
compared on their own, and are not read in arithmetic.

A side absent at a coordinate compares false there, and under a summing operator the absent term
is one fewer. A comparison against the previous row gives its `shift` an
`edge=`, and a `position()` term keeps the first row out:

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
parameters:
  load: { dims: [snapshot] }
  ramp: { dims: [] }
variables:
  shed: { dims: [snapshot], bounds: { lower: 0 } }
constraints:
  shed_when_load_jumps:
    dims: [snapshot]
    where: "load - shift(load, along=snapshot, offset=1, edge=0) > ramp AND position(snapshot) > 0"
    expression: shed >= load - ramp
```

A [case `when:`](named.md#the-rules-that-keep-the-cases-apart) may compare
expressions only in a block with one case. A comparison with a number on both sides, such as `2 < 1`, is
refused everywhere.

### `position()`

`position(dim)` counts along the order `shift` steps along, not the label:

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
parameters:
  soc_initial: { dims: [] }
variables:
  soc: { dims: [snapshot], bounds: { lower: 0 } }
constraints:
  soc_start:
    dims: [snapshot]
    where: "position(snapshot) == 0" # not: snapshot == 0
    expression: soc == soc_initial
```

A position that no coordinate occupies is an error when the data is attached.

`by=` counts inside each group a [partition](relations.md#partitions) makes, so
each period gets one seeded row:

```yaml
dimensions:
  snapshot: { dtype: int }
  period: { dtype: int }
relations:
  period_of: { key: snapshot, values: period }
parameters:
  soc_initial: { dims: [period] }
variables:
  soc: { dims: [snapshot], bounds: { lower: 0 } }
constraints:
  soc_start:
    dims: [snapshot]
    where: "position(snapshot, by=period_of, within=period) == 0"
    expression: soc == at(soc_initial, by=period_of, over=period, into=snapshot)
```

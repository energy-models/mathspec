# Typeset the math

`to_latex`, `to_typst` and `to_markdown` print a spec as the equations it
stands for, from the file alone. No data is attached, and no solver runs.

```python
import mathspec as ms

spec = ms.to_spec('spec.yaml')  # read and checked once, then printed three ways

print(ms.to_latex(spec))  # amsmath align
print(ms.to_typst(spec))  # compiles without a TeX toolchain
print(ms.to_markdown(spec))  # renders as-is on GitHub
```

Each function takes a path, the YAML, a mapping, a `Spec` or a `Program`, and
prints the program: the one a spec holds, or the one it was handed.
From a shell, `python -m mathspec latex spec.yaml` prints the same, and
`typst` or `markdown` in place of `latex` picks the format.

[Print a spec as math](../howto/print.md) is the recipe, and
[every operator as math](language/operators.md#every-operator-as-math) shows
what each operator prints.

## Options

The three functions take the same keywords, and the command line spells each as
a flag. The [Python API](api.md#typesetting) gives each signature.

|                      |                        |                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `symbols`            | `--symbols FILE`       | How the names print. See [symbol tables](#symbol-tables). Default: derived from the names in the file                           |
| `standalone`         | `--standalone`         | Emit a document that compiles. Default: a fragment to include                                                                   |
| `legend`             | `--no-legend`          | Print the table of sets, parameters, variables and definitions above the math. Default: on                                      |
| `numbered`           | `--no-numbers`         | Number the equations. Default: on                                                                                               |
| `inline_expressions` | `--inline-expressions` | Substitute each named expression that the math reads into the equations that read it, instead of defining it once. Default: off |
| —                    | `--expand`             | Print the variables and constraints the `piecewise:` and `sos:` blocks state, rather than the blocks. Default: off              |

`-o FILE` writes to a file instead of stdout.

- The spec's `description:` opens the document.
- A `piecewise:` block prints as one line: the curve it states, over the frame
  it states one curve per coordinate of. To print its rows, print
  [`spec.expand()`](api.md#mathspec.Spec.expand) or pass `--expand`
  ([see an expansion](../howto/see-an-expansion.md)).
- An [`assumptions:`](language/assumptions.md) entry prints under an
  **Assumptions** heading, last, beside what each curve assumes of its
  breakpoints. A spec that assumes nothing of its data prints no such
  heading.
- A [named expression](language/named.md) prints its symbol where it is used
  and its body once, under a **Definitions** heading, in declaration order. A
  `cases:` block and a [reported entry](language/named.md#reported-expressions)
  keep their definition line under either `inline_expressions` setting. An
  [empty sum](language/named.md#expressions) prints last, as `symbol = ⋯`.
- Wherever the math moves an index, which every `shift` does, the document
  prints a line saying what that notation means.
- A file that does not load does not print.
- Lines are not broken. A wide equation runs off the page.

## Markdown's delimiters

`to_markdown` prints math between the two pairs GitHub and GitLab read
verbatim: ``$`…`$`` inline, and a ` ```math ` fence for a block. It never
prints `$…$` or `$$…$$`. For a renderer that reads `$…$` alone, print with
`to_latex` and write that renderer's delimiters around the result.

## Descriptions

A `description:` is **plain prose, with one piece of notation**. A name in
backticks, such as `` `capital_cost` ``, sets in monospace in every output
format. Everything else is text, and each format escapes whatever its own
syntax would read as markup. The legend prints the description of every
dimension, parameter and variable.

## Printing one declaration on its own

`typeset_declaration` returns the line the document prints for one named
expression, constraint, assumption or variable, with its quantifier and without
a document, a label, a number or math delimiters:

```python
ms.typeset_declaration('spec.yaml', 'spend', 'latex')
# \mathit{spend}_{t} = \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{dispatch}_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{cost}_{g} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T}
ms.typeset_declaration('spec.yaml', 'balance', 'latex')
# \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{dispatch}_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T}
```

It takes what the other functions take, plus the name, the format and an
optional `symbols` table. A Markdown line arrives without delimiters too, so put
it inside the inline pair:

```python
line = ms.typeset_declaration('spec.yaml', 'balance', 'markdown')
print(f'The balance holds: $`{line}`$')
```

A line on its own has no _Definitions_ section beside it, so the plain named
expressions it uses are substituted. A cased expression prints by symbol, and a
second call with its name prints its block.

A name that is none of the four kinds is refused with the near miss. A name
declared as two of them, such as a constraint and a variable, is refused too.

## Symbol tables

With no table, the symbols are **derived** from the names in the file, such as
$\mathrm{load}_t$ and $\mathrm{capacity}_g$. A symbol table makes the output
conventional. Pass a path to a YAML file, the same keys as a dict, or a
`ms.SymbolTable`:

```yaml
# dispatch.symbols.yaml
notation: latex
dimensions:
  snapshot: { index: s, set: "\\mathcal{S}" }
  generator: { index: g, set: "\\mathcal{G}" }
names:
  cost: c
  load: "\\ell"
  capacity: "\\bar p"
```

```python
ms.to_latex('dispatch.yaml', symbols='dispatch.symbols.yaml')
```

| Section      |                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `notation`   | **Required.** `latex` or `typst`: the language the entries are written in       |
| `dimensions` | For each dimension, an `index` letter and a `set` symbol. Either may be omitted |
| `names`      | For each parameter, variable or named expression, its symbol                    |

Every spelling is printed as you wrote it, and nothing translates notation, so
rendering a LaTeX table as Typst is refused. A key that names nothing in the
spec, and nothing a formulation of it emits, is an error with the near miss.

Nothing in a symbol table changes what the file means.

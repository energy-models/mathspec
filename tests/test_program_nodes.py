"""Every node a `Program` can carry is one some file actually lowers to.

The lowering-side sibling of `test_the_golden_model_carries_every_node_kind_the_walk_renders`,
on a fixture of its own because rendering accepts what lowering refuses.

Without this, a node can join `Expression` with nothing producing it and
the suite stays green — `assert_never` fires only where some test happens to
lower a file that uses the construct. That is how `cases:` reached a release
candidate unlowerable.

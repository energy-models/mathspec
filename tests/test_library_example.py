"""The component library under `examples/library/`, held to what its pages claim.

The gallery test holds each page to its generator, so the math on a page cannot
drift from the file above it. What is left for here is what no page states: that
every fragment stands alone, that the composition is one spec, and that the
variant patch, the one file in the library that is not a spec, applies to what
the fragments make.

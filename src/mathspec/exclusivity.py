"""Can two of a named expression's cases claim one coordinate? Decided without data.

Each ``when`` is read over cells: regions of one subject's value on which every
atom is constant. The cells of the pair's subjects are multiplied out, both
masks are evaluated on each, and a cell where both hold is a witness.
Independence between subjects over-approximates, so it can manufacture a
witness but never hide one. The rule itself is stated in

"""Provably unbounded specs, named before a solver says a bare ``unbounded``.

A variable unbounded on the side its objective term improves toward, and named
by no constraint, runs to infinity for any data. Which side is read off the
sign the variable enters the objective with: under ``minimize`` a ``+v`` term
runs down toward ``lower``. Where that sign is not decidable without data — a
parameter coefficient, or occurrences of both signs — nothing is claimed.

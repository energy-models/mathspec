"""How this project reads a YAML file.

`yaml.safe_load` implements YAML 1.1, and two of its rules are wrong for a
language whose scalars are user data; both are fixed here:

- **1.2 booleans.** ``on``/``off``/``yes``/``no``/``y``/``n`` are ordinary
  names in this language — a country code as a dimension, a mode as a relation.
  YAML 1.1 resolves them to ``True``/``False``; only ``true``/``false`` are
  booleans here, which is the YAML 1.2 core schema.
- **Duplicate keys.** 1.1 lets the last one win silently, discarding a
  declaration the file plainly contains.

The output is plain ``dict``/``str``: no loader wrapper reaches the schema
or the AST.

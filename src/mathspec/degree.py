"""Degree — the one admissibility rule that is a scope choice (docs/about/limits.md).

**Degree 2 in the math, degree 1 in what stands beside it.** An objective and a
constraint both take ``variable * variable``; a *bound* and a ``piecewise:``
link do not — each of those is read affinely. An ``expressions:`` entry is not
degree-checked at declaration at all: the math reading it is checked where it
reads, at that position's own ceiling, and an entry the math never reads
(``ExpressionDeclaration.in_math``) is held to no degree.

A degree-2 product has a second rule: **at most one factor may be a sum of
terms**. ``sum(x, over=i) * sum(y, over=j)`` is a cross join whose size the
file states nowhere. Factors carrying *different dims* are not that: ``x[i] *
y[j]`` broadcasts.

"""Expand ``piecewise:`` blocks into plain variables and constraints.

A block becomes ordinary affine declarations when a caller asks
[`expand`][mathspec.spec.Spec.expand] for them, under names prefixed with the
block's own; what each method emits is tabled in
``docs/reference/language/piecewise.md``. Every rule a block is held to is
decided as the spec loads, before its rows are written: the names it
references in [`reference_errors`][mathspec.validation.reference_errors], its
links and its ``where:`` as lowering types them, and the fit of each link's row
to its expression, its values and the mask in [`declaration_of`][]. A refusal
names the link or key the file wrote rather than an emitted declaration.

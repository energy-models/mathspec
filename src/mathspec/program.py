"""The program: what a file declares, with names resolved and shapes fixed.

The second public state, and the one a consumer reads. A [`Program`][] is
the file typed, section for section: every declaration it makes, with names
resolved, shapes fixed and every rule decidable without data checked, and no
data at all. Lowering, as a [`Spec`][mathspec.spec.Spec] loads, is the only
thing that builds one, so nothing here re-checks a hand-built one.

Node and declaration classes are matched with ``isinstance``. The rules a
node's structure does not show is [`children`][]; the questions over the walk
are [`walk_regions`][], [`walk`][] and the filters beside them. A
resolved ``where`` arrives as a [`Mask`][], and what
[`advice`][mathspec.advice] says about a program as [`Advice`][]. Frozen dataclasses only — no
execution logic, and nothing imported from a consumer. How a consumer reads
one: ``docs/reference/reading.md``.

    A rolling-horizon or myopic driver cuts an axis into windows and builds
    each on its own, and a decomposition cuts the same axis and solves each
    piece on its own. What the program can say is whether every row it builds
    is then complete inside one window: how far a row reads ahead along the
    axis, which declarations tie the axis together so that no window holds
    them, and — the same fact read as a set — which rows and columns are left
    over as the border every window shares. It cannot say whether the windowed
    answer is the one a whole-horizon solve would give — a store carried over
    one row windows cleanly, and a rolling solve of it is still a different
    answer — which is the driver's design and not the spec's.

    What a row reads *behind* is not reported. A window starts where the
    driver puts it, and what its first rows meet there is the edge policy:
    the opening state a rolling horizon seeds, and the driver's to carry.

    Attributes:
        dimension: The axis asked about.
        ahead: Coordinates a window must see after its last row for every row
            it builds to be complete — what a negative ``shift`` reads. ``0``
            is pointwise; a ``shift`` of ``-2`` is ``2``.
        coupled: Each declaration that ties the axis together, to what ties it
            and the one change to the spec that would not: a sum over the axis
            in a constraint, a grouping that consumes it, a wrapped
            translation, a set. No window satisfies these, and no rewrite here
            would keep the spec's meaning, so the remedy is named rather than
            applied.
        undecided: Each read along the axis whose reach only data can say —
            a named offset, a partition whose groups a window may cut, a read
            through a relation at a coordinate the data chooses.
            [`resolved`][] folds a parameter's values in.
        restarts: Each declaration counting a position along the axis, which a
            window restarts at its first row. Whether that is wanted — a seed
            once per window, or once per horizon — is for the spec's author to decide, so it is
            reported rather than refused.
        linking_rows: Each constraint no one window holds whole, in declaration
            order: one the axis does not index, whose row stands in every
            window, and one [`coupled`][] names. A reach the data decides is
            not one, so a row waiting on [`undecided`][] may span two windows.
        linking_columns: Each variable the axis does not index, in declaration
            order, whose column every window reads. A decomposition calls a
            window a block, and with [`linking_rows`][] this is the border of
            a bordered block-diagonal form cut along the axis, whole where
            nothing is [`undecided`][] and no set runs through it. A set
            couples the axis without building a row, so it stands in neither

"""Lower a spec to a [`Program`][] — the pass that decides every expression.

One lowering, on the language side, run when a [`Spec`][]
loads: it reads every expression and where string into the program's own
nodes, checks every rule decidable without data, and packages the
declarations, section for section. The program mirrors the spec it was
lowered from: a ``piecewise:`` block the spec still declares is a curve on
the program, and [`expand`][mathspec.spec.Spec.expand] is what writes it out
as rows.

def lower(schema: Spec) -> Program:
    """Lower *schema*'s own declarations, checking every rule decidable without data.

    What is checked:

    - every rule one declaration is held to against the others
      ([`reference_errors`][]), before any expression
      is read, since resolution assumes each of them;
    - the expression parses, and constraints hold exactly one comparison where
      objectives hold none;
    - every referenced name resolves, and every operator is a built-in whose
      dimension arguments name declared dimensions;
    - where strings parse *and* resolve — an unknown name there is an error,
      not a silently-empty mask;
    - macro formals may shadow the spec's names but not a declared dimension, since
      ``over=snapshot`` under a formal ``snapshot`` cannot say which it means;
    - no name a set or curve writes out is one the file declares
      ([`emitted_name_errors`][]), read off the
      curve as lowered;
    - every dim rule (``dimensions.check_schema``), once names resolve.

    A ``piecewise:`` block's links are resolved and its frame checked here, on
    the link the file wrote, so the expansion writes rows the language has
    already held to every rule; what its method assumes of the breakpoints
    stands under the program's assumptions with the file's own, so a spec
    states what it assumes whether or not its curves are written out.

    Returns:
        The program of what *schema* declares, section for section.

    Raises:
        SchemaError: Listing every problem found, one per line. A name a set
            or curve writes that the file declares is listed once every other
            problem is gone, since it is read off the curve as lowered.

            name resolves.

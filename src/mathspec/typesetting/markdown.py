r"""GitHub-flavoured Markdown. GitHub renders math with MathJax, so the math is [`LatexFormat`][]'s and only the document layer differs.

Both delimiters are the verbatim pair — ``$`…`$`` inline and a ``math`` fence
for a block — because GitHub runs Markdown's escape pass *inside* a ``$…$``
span, stripping the backslash from every escape TeX needs: ``\mathrm{gen\_bus}``
reached MathJax as ``\mathrm{gen_bus}``, a subscript, and ``\{0, 1\}`` as a
group with no braces. The verbatim pair hands the span over untouched, so the
math this prints is the math [`latex`][] prints, and
stays what every other MathJax and KaTeX reads too.

"""Several files into one spec, each checked as a spec where it is one.

Two verbs, and they answer different questions. [`merge`][] composes
**peers**: fragments that each own part of the math, where a name two of them
declare is a collision and the order they are given in means nothing.
[`override`][] lays **patches** over a **base**: what a framework ships and a
project extends, where a name the patch declares is the point. They compose as
``override(merge({...}), {...})``, which builds the spec and then configures
the run.

[`merge`][] writes nothing a fragment did not write, except a ``+``. It
joins two fragments' text in two places, the objective and a named expression
that terms add to; every other block is copied as written, refused where two
fragments own it, or held identical where it is a dimension or a relation.
What that means for each section:

* **A dimension or a relation every fragment may declare**, and the ones that
  do have to say the same thing about it. Prose is not a claim, so two
  descriptions of one dimension agree, and the first in the fragments' name
  order is carried: the order they are passed in reaches no description.
* **Every other declaration is owned.** A name two fragments declare is refused,
  both named.
* **The objectives are summed**, each term in parentheses, in the fragments'
  name order, and the senses have to agree.
* **A term is added to the expression it names.** A ``given: expressions:``
  entry with a ``term:`` names the expression its fragment adds to the name.
  The name is an ``expressions:`` block of one other fragment: a sum with a
  frame and no body, or a definition. The composed spec writes its body as
  that body, if it has one, plus every term by its name, in the fragments'
  name order, and keeps each term as the named expression its fragment
  declares. A definition written as ``cases:`` is refused, since it is summed
  as written. A later merge adds to the composed body the same way. A term
  that names no ``expressions:`` block of any fragment is refused: merge
  fills or extends what a file declared, and never invents a name.
* **A given declaration is folded** into the declaration that introduces the
  name, once the reader is checked to say the same as the introducer or less.
  A given expression's body may carry no dimension its reader does not state,
  and a name read as one kind and introduced as another is refused. A
  reader's description fills a declaration its owner left undescribed.
  Two fragments that both read a name have to read it over one frame, as a
  set. What no fragment introduces stays under ``given:`` until a host model
  provides it.

A patch says only what it changes, because declarations are laid over a field
at a time::

    constraints:
      ramp: {dims: [snapshot, generator, investment_period]}

A fragment is a [`Spec`][mathspec.spec.Spec] of its own, and a base is one
too: each goes through [`to_spec`][mathspec.validation.to_spec] before anything is
composed, so a composed spec never hides a file that does not load alone. A
patch is not one. It names only what it changes and may carry ``null`` where a
declaration would go, so it is laid over as written, and the result goes
through [`to_spec`][mathspec.validation.to_spec] like any other file.

What a patch may say, and what is refused:

* **A partial entry edits, and a whole one creates.** An entry that does not
  validate as a declaration on its own has to land on one the base declares,
  and a miss is refused with the near miss named.
* **Sibling patches are disjoint.** Two patches writing one field is refused,
  both named, so the order they are given in never decides a spec. Layering
  is written out as ``override(override(base, …), …)``.
* **A patch adjusts the math, not the coordinate space.** A ``dimensions`` or
  ``relations`` entry may be added or restated word for word, never changed and
  never removed.
* ``null`` **makes what it names absent.** A declaration set to ``null`` is
  removed, and a removal of what the base does not declare is refused. A field
  set to ``null`` is dropped, and takes its default when the result loads:
  ``variables: {p: {bounds: {upper: null}}}`` opens that bound. A whole section
  set to ``null`` is refused, because it removes nothing.
* **``given:`` is laid over one kind at a time**, by the same rules as any
  owned section.

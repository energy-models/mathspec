    One traversal rather than one per axis, because every construct that ties an

    is about answers for all of them at what answering for one cost.

    ``reductions_couple`` is the position a block stands in rather than anything
    about the block — a sum over the axis couples a constraint row to the whole
    horizon and leaves an objective additively separable. A translation reads
    ahead for a negative offset; what one reads behind is the window's edge,
    which is not asked. Each coupling carries the one change to the spec that
    would lift it, after the dash.

    The border a decomposition cuts along falls out of the same walk, which is
    why it is taken here rather than in a pass of its own: a constraint the axis
    does not index, and one a coupling names, are the rows no window holds.

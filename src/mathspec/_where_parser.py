"""The where-string grammar and the ``Unresolved*`` nodes it emits, package-private.

A where string is a boolean algebra over comparisons, and a comparison's
sides are the expression grammar's own arithmetic. What a side *is* — a
parameter, a dimension, a relation column, a ``position()`` — only the schema
knows, so the grammar hands both sides over bare and
[`mathspec.resolution`][] reads them. The resolved vocabulary lives in
[`mathspec.program`][].

"""Expand ``sos:`` blocks into the binaries and rows that state the same restriction.

A set becomes ordinary declarations under names prefixed with the block's own,
the way a ``piecewise:`` block becomes weights and rows; what it emits is
tabled in ``docs/reference/language/piecewise.md``. An unpicked member is held
at zero from both sides, so the rewrite states the same feasible set whatever
sign the member takes — what it needs is a coefficient on each side, which a
spec declaring a set without is refused at load for
([`mathspec.spec.Spec`][] validates it) rather than here.

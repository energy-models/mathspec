"""Name resolution — the pass that reads the syntax tree into the program vocabulary.

The grammars emit bare names and calls; resolution builds the
[`mathspec.program`][] node each stands for, so every pass after — the dim
rules, the degree rules, the typesetter, lowering — reads one vocabulary. This
module holds the [`Namespace`][] a resolution reads names from and the doors
lowering calls, one per kind of text; the walks are
[`ExpressionResolver`][] for arithmetic and
[`WhereResolver`][] for a where string. The rules
live in the language reference.

    Keyword arguments come in four kinds, and the kind decides what resolution
    turns the value into: ``dimension_kwargs`` name a dimension or a list of
    them (``sum(x, over=generator)``); ``column_kwargs`` name columns of one
    relation, written ``relation[column, …]`` (``sum(x, over=generator,
    by=gen_bus[bus])``), and beside one a ``dimension_kwargs`` name is a
    column of that relation where it has one; ``edge_kwargs`` take a closed
    keyword or a number;
    ``required_value_kwargs`` are ordinary values that must be present — a
    number, never a name to resolve (``shift(..., offset=1)``).

    Every operator takes one positional argument, the expression; every
    dimension or column it names arrives in a kwarg *value*, which is what
    lets a macro pass one as a formal. ``usage`` is the wording every refusal
    quotes back.
